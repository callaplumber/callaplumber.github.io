<p>Kitchen sinks are always susceptible to clogs with food and grease being the significant perpetrators. They harden to the piping walls if fats are put down the sink. Food follows the grease down the plumbing, connecting to the walls also. Even tree roots can produce severe drain blockages by twisting around pipes. Their crushing strength stops the water flow, forcing plumbers to find and repair the issue for regular home plumbing operations. You need your drain cleaned up before it leads to further damage and even more expensive repairs if this is what is taking place to your house.</p>

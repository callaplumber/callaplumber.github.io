<p>A total repipe of a home's water supply, typically done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most pricey and complex plumbing task, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company specializing in whole house repiping. Recent Evaluation: Carlos and Lopez were remarkable. My 90 year old Daddy's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos got to 8am the next day to repair. It was a challenging job because of the age of the house and area of the pipe. They worked for nearly 12 hours into darkness to ensure the system was working before they left. I am truly grateful for their effort and professionalism.</p>

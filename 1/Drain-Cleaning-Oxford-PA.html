If you are experiencing a leak coming from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Also, ensure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undiscovered issue. Try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>

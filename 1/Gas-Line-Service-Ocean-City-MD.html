<p>Figuring out if you need a water softener is an individual preference. Water softener systems work by eliminating solidity minerals and replacing them with sodium ions. Water conditioners are gadgets that help prevent the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They use a physical media to prevent the scale from building up by reducing the effects of the solidity itself. Due to the fact that water conditioners utilize a physical media rather of a chemical media, they are often considered a greener option in areas where it is prohibited to utilize salt.

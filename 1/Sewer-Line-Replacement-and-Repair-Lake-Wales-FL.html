How to inform if you have polybutylene pipes: If your pipes are white plastic and include the letters PB" in the printed label, you have polybutylene pipes and we suggest having them changed right now. Before you can ask for an inspection, you must first get the required permit( s) for the work you mean to do. You can take a look at our Permit page to learn more on obtaining an authorization. As soon as you get a license you can begin with the work. However, you need to require inspection prior to you hide any work or cover.</p>
<p>However, most of the time, it's safe to state that any repairs that need to be completed will come out of the pocketbook of a homeowner.

<p>In 1939, after his Roto-Rooter sewer cleaning machine proved effective, Sam Blanc designed and constructed a smaller model that operated on the same concept however might clean and clear bathroom and kitchen sink drains as well as laundry drains and other household plumbing drains. Blanc also developed a much larger variation of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It needed to be hauled by a truck and included a 10 hp fuel engine and 1000 feet of steel cable.

<p>The program achieves its objective by offering the adoption and promulgation of ideal rules and guidelines for the building and construction of plumbing facilities where mandated. Cold showers? High energy costs? It may be time for a brand-new warm water heater. However in order to profit of a new energy-efficient appliance, you'll need to have it installed correctly. A hot water heater that is not set up correctly can lead to water damage, scalding temperatures, or perhaps a fire. That's why installation is best left to professional plumbers who know the ins and outs of your plumbing system.</p>

If, say, you need a new burner package and the water heater is 5 years old, then it makes good sense for you to spend the $120 for the part, specifically if you can do the work yourself. The closer the appliance is to that 8 to 12-year limitation, the more doubtful the economics of a repair becomes. The factor is that some other part on the home appliance will go or its tank will leak. And there's no treatment for a leaking tank.</p>

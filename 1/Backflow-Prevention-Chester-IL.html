<p>Your garbage disposal ensures that your sink and plumbing components don't get clogged. Contrary to some people's understanding, garbage disposals do not include blades. Instead, a waste disposal unit includes 2 fixed bolts that are repaired to a spinning disk.

This high-speed action effectively crushes the food waste in the disposal so that it can take a trip down the drain without blocking.</p>

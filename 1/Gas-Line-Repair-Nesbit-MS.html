<p>The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania presently has no licensure or accreditation requirements for many construction contractors (or their employees). The secret to the technology is having the ability to manage both the crystal development rate and their removal from our polymer beads, therefore eliminating hardness ions and producing a water softening advantage that does not need replacement chemicals or regrowth of active sites," mentioned Dr. Rakesh Govind, co-founder of SofTap Water and chief technology officer. This technology is more cost reliable and lasts longer than typical water softening items such as ion exchange or reverse osmosis," continued Dr. Govind.</p>

<p>Water softening makes use of a process called "ion exchange" to eliminate liquified hard water minerals such as calcium, manganese, iron and magnesium. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular response is required. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto sodium, and as the tough water flows through the resin, the sodium is swapped for the hard water minerals. The hard water minerals are caught in the softener and a trace quantity of sodium drains with the softened water.</p>

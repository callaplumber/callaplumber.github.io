<p>Sometimes, an inexperienced individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as basic as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he creates data on the workings of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's duty to know what the field test data implies for that specific assembly.  When a trained tester interprets the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>

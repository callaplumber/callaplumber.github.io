<p>Water softening uses a process called "ion exchange" to remove dissolved difficult water minerals such as calcium, iron, manganese and magnesium. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular response is needed. Water softeners have resin beads that keep sodium, and as the hard water flows through the resin, the sodium is switched for the tough water minerals. The difficult water minerals are trapped in a trace and the softener amount of salt drains with the softened water.</p>
<p>Keeping your garbage dispoal clean isn't really difficult or time consuming. Fill the sink a minimum of half full of soapy water.

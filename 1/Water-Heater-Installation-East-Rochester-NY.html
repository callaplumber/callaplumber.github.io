<p>Water softening uses a process called "ion exchange" to remove dissolved difficult water minerals such as calcium, iron, manganese and magnesium. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular response is needed. Water softeners have resin beads that keep sodium, and as the hard water flows through the resin, the sodium is switched for the tough water minerals. The difficult water minerals are trapped in a trace and the softener amount of salt drains with the softened water.</p>
<p>Keeping your garbage dispoal clean isn't really difficult or time consuming. Fill the sink a minimum of half full of soapy water. Get rid of the stopper from the drain while simultaneously switching on the disposal. This will fill the entire disposal with soapy water and help to eliminate food accumulation. It will also clean the blades and flush your pipes with clean water.</p>
<p>Gas line leakages are a severe safety concern. Do not take any chances. Ensure the softener is set to the solidity of your water supply.

<p>One common way for a house's supply of water to be contaminated is if the watering water lines, which might become polluted by pesticides or weed toxin, backflow into the interior water lines. The problem might spread exponentially if that polluted water were to backflow into the neighborhood drinking supply. A backflow preventer not only secures drinking water in specific residences, it also prevents wastewater in private homes from flowing back out and infecting the general public water supply.</p>
<p>A backflow preventer is a way or mechanism to prevent backflow. The basic methods of avoiding backflow is an air space, which either removes a cross-connection or provides a barrier to backflow. The standard system for preventing backflow is a mechanical backflow preventer, which provides a physical barrier to backflow. The primary types of mechanical backflow preventers are the reduced-pressure concept assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the double check valve assembly.</p>

<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the incoming safe and clean supply of water. Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when negative or reduced pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, typically due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A common kind of backflow preventer is the reduced pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>

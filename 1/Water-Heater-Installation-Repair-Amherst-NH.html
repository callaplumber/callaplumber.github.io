<p>Lots of house owners will use a store-bought chemical drain cleaner to resolve their dirty or clogged drain problems. These chemicals are easy to use and inexpensive, but they harm your pipes and their results are just short term. Store-bought liquid drain cleaners utilize extreme chemicals to eat away at the clog and with repeated use, these chemicals will also gnaw at the pipe producing weak points that are susceptible to burst. This is why professional drain cleaning from a drain cleaning company is constantly suggested.</p>
<p>An experienced plumber like Matt Mertz Plumbing, Inc. can help you choose when it's time to replace your pipes. As piping installation and repair professionals, we can fix problems or point out when it will be safer or more cost-effective to merely redo your piping system.

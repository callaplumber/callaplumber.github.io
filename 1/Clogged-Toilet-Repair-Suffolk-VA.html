<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the inbound potable water supply. Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature level increases in boilers, or if there is a decline in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage happens when negative or reduced pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, normally due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A common type of backflow preventer is the reduced pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>

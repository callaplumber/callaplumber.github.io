<p>When a flush valve causes a toilet to run, a used flapper is typically the perpetrator. But not constantly. Initially, look at the chain that raises the flapper. It can tangle up and avoid the flapper from closing securely if there's too much slack in the chain. A chain with insufficient slack can cause difficulty too. Image 3 demonstrates how to set the slack perfect.</p>
<p>Below the sink, stack the fiber gasket, backup flange, and installing ring, and slide onto the underside of the flange. Install the snap ring by pulling it open and snapping into location.

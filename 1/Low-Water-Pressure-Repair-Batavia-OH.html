<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, effective, and a terrific man. He informed me exactly what to anticipate (cost, time, process) in advance and delivered as guaranteed. I will certainly utilize Clog Dawg once again. Installing a garbage disposal takes 2 to 3 hours with a typical hourly rate of $25 to $70. These rates remain in addition to the cost of the disposal unit. The total you pay may be greater if your plumber has a minimum callout cost that is higher than the labor cost for the work.</p>

<p>A partial reroute is generally a little scale repiping of several afflicted locations of the plumbing below the slab.

Costing less than a full repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can accumulate in cost very rapidly.

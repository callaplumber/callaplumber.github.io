Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when negative or lower pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, typically due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A typical type of backflow preventer is the minimized pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>

Initially, plans for each device to be installed must be prepared by a RA or PE, and an application for approval sent out to the DEP, which may use up to 3 weeks or more to authorize and process. Rejected plans must be revised and resubmitted to the DEP approval queue, which can add another a number of weeks to the timeline.</p>

Some toilets, however, have actually distinctively shaped bowls and require a particular seat, like the Eljer Emblem. It truly isn't a good idea to utilize a toilet seat that is either much too big or much to little, unless they have actually been specifically designed to fit normal toilets, as the toilet seat can wobble and cause you to slide around, or won't distribute your weight evenly and might ultimately cause fractures in the bowl.</p>

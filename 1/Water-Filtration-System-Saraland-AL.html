<h3>Residential Plumbing Contractor Saraland AL</h3>
<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can create increases in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in safe and clean water supply pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being used goes beyond the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>

<h3>Helpful Tips For Choosing The Right Plumbing Service Lowell MA</h3>
<p>Backflow preventer installation requires the services of a licensed professional engineer (PE) or licensed registered architect (RA), and licensed master plumber (LMP). A licensed professional can help you figure out if your building requires a backflow preventer or several devices, or if you receive an exemption. Exemptions, which are approved in incredibly unusual cases where the structure is considered to not present a danger to the water supply, should be filed with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the homeowner. If your building has an existing backflow preventer, but the DEP has no record of its installation, you should have a licensed professional file a record illustration of the device, along with an initial test report of the device for DEP evaluation.</p>
<p>In some cases a clog can be caused due to accumulation and grease within the system. If this is the case, snaking the drain won't fix the concern. You may have to look into utilizing a high pressure water supply to remove the clog. This process is a bit more pricey and will cost anywhere from $400-$ 1000, depending on the severity of the clog. There are two basic piping materials used by plumbing experts. PEX and copper both use many advantages and benefits such as getting rid of the metal taste from your water.</p>

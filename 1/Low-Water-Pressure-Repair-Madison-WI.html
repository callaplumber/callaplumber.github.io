<p>In addition to water softening systems, Rinckey said that reverse osmosis systems (ROs) are rather popular with house owners in the area. He kept in mind that there are specific contaminants that citizens are handling and an RO can help alleviate those issues. Due to being largely farming in Montcalm and Ionia counties, some property owners are setting up ROs to rid their water source of nitrates that are a product of agricultural waste.

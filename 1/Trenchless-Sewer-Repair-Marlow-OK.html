<p>Loose flanges are generally the result of wood rot. The flange screws merely won't hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best option depends upon the extent of the rot.

Prior to you install this kind of ring, hold it approximately the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may need to cut off a number of ears to make it deal with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll need to replace an area of the subfloor.</p>

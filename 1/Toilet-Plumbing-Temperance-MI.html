<p>Deluge systems are designed so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems typically are set up in locations where the possibility of a severe fire condition is likely, such as airplane garages. Water to the system is kept back by the deluge valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire takes place, the detection system sends a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then allows water to discharge from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>

<p>The old disposal needs to be detached first. Garbage disposals are generally linked at the base therefore this is where the procedure starts. Some electrical knowledge is needed to ensure the wires are disconnected properly. Answer: No! They do not have a lawn sprinkler, or any outdoor watering system at all, so they do not need backflow prevention.</p>
<p>At any time the pressure on the home (downstream) side surpasses the pressure on the city side, the 2 redundant check valves close-- preventing any backflow. However, while DCV systems are considered safe for the majority of fire security systems, they do have a defect: if both valves stop working or particles in the water line avoids them from closing completely, backflow can happen.</p>

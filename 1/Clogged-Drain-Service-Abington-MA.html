<p>A. Typically wax does not "spoil" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Likewise, make sure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undiscovered problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, attempt putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>

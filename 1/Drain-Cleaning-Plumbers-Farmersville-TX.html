If you are experiencing a leak originating from below the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Also, ensure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undetected problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>

Demand-control designs, with either mechanical and electrical sensors, usually regrow after a lot of gallons of water have actually been softened. Such models are hassle-free if you have an ever-changing water utilize schedule.</p>

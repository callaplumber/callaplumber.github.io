It is important that the repair service technician knows the correct installation orientation and can evaluate the installation conditions to make sure there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly.

Most backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, however it is essential that the assembly only be set up if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation might trigger the backflow prevention assembly to not work effectively and no matter the number of parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work because the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>

<p>Button Plumbing was great. They changed my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly leaked in the past if I turned off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into.

I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was very delighted with their service.</p>

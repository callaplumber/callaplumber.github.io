<h3>What Kinds Of Tools Do Plumbers Use Ripley WV</h3>
<p>Backflow preventer installation needs the services of a licensed professional engineer (PE) or licensed registered architect (RA), and licensed master plumber (LMP). A licensed professional can help you determine if your structure requires a backflow preventer or multiple devices, or if you qualify for an exemption. Exemptions, which are granted in incredibly rare cases where the structure is considered to not position a threat to the supply of water, need to be filed with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the homeowner. If your building has an existing backflow preventer, but the DEP has no record of its installation, you should have a licensed professional file a record illustration of the device, as well as a preliminary test report of the device for DEP review.</p>

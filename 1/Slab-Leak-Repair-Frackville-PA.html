A toilet's tank is made up of several small moving parts, such as flapper valves and fill valves, that need to be changed or fixed due to their frequent usage. When these parts wear, they result in tiny leakages that are difficult to see with the naked eye. This is why it is very important to call a plumber as quickly as you think you have a leak or a broken tank part. Not only does a leaking toilet waste water, it can also result in flooding and water damage.</p>

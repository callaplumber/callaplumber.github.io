<p>House water softeners, likewise called ion exchange systems, are home appliances that eliminate calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for sodium or potassium. As soon as the resin beads become full of calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium option removes the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After travelling through the beads, the resulting chloride service ends up being a waste stream that goes down the drain and eventually into the environment.</p>
<p>Deluge systems are developed so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems generally are set up in areas where the possibility of an extreme fire condition is likely, such as airplane garages. Water to the system is kept back by the deluge valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire takes place, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then allows water to release from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>

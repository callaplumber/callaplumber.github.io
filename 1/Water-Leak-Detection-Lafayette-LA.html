<p>I have actually been impressed with your company and its people from the day your sales person strolled in here, through all service personel, and now. By the way, this is a fantastic system. Our energy costs are much lower then before, the air flow is almost unnoticeable, the air temperature within is even, the humidity contstant, and we have had no failures given that installation.</p>

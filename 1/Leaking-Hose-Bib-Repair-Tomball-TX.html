<p>Backflow is the unfavorable reversal of flow in a drinkable water circulation system. Water that is always under pressure can only stream in one direction. Then how can water flow in reverse? Water will always flow towards the point of lowest pressure. If a water pipe were to break or if the fire department opened a number of fire hydrants to help battle a fire, the pressure in the water pipe might drop. The demand upstream might trigger a turnaround in flow.</p>
<p>We can have a competent specialist to your residential or commercial property within the hour when you call throughout our standard business hours. If you presume your plumbing is breaking down, or you're already facing a plumbing concern, do not be reluctant to call our emergency action service to experience reliable, top quality services provided by our experts at Bob Oates Plumbing, Sewer, & Rooter today.</p>

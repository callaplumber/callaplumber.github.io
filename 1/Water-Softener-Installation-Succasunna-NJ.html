<p>Changing your sink is a detailed procedure. Measure, cut, and link the pipes. Prior to attaching any pipes to your water softener, measure and cut your pipes to fit. Solder on any nipples and fittings prior to connecting the system to the bypass valve to prevent melting the plastic if you are using copper pipes. Seal all threads with plumber's tape. Plastic tubing like PEX can also be utilized. Though it may need additional adapters, flexible tubing is far much easier to deal with and can use push-to-connect fittings, conserving you time and the inconvenience of soldering.</p>
<p>You may be lured to bond or patch a leak shut or replace only a single section of pipe to save money. While this might work in the short term, keep in mind that the weakened pipe is made from the same material as other pipes in your house, suggesting that trouble might be brewing in other places in your plumbing system. Repiping now will offer you assurance and avoid larger leaks down the road.</p>

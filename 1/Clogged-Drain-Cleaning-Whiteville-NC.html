<p>Your house's drainage works by the basic force of gravity. When you flush water and squander down your sink or shower (and your toilets as well) it's not really the circulation of water pressing them down your pipes. Instead, once they decrease your drain, gravity takes control of as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a downward angle to the sewer line. Anything you put down there will not go through when something obstructs the pipes.</p>

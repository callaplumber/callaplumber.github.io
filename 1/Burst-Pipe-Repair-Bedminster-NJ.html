It is important that the repair technician understands the proper installation orientation and can examine the installation conditions to ensure there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly must be set up in the installation orientation for which it was authorized. Many backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade.

<p>Pipeline leak detection is used to figure out if and in some cases where a leak has occurred in systems which include liquids and gases. Applications vary from softening in remote areas to attending to issues of reagent addition. Motor sizes for garbage disposal are given up horse power, or HP.

Packaged chemicals soften water in small batches, such as washing machine loads, but render the water undrinkable, take a toll on clothes, and, in some cases, consist of phosphates that harm the environment. A clogged sewer pipe might leave you ripe for a drain-cleaning scam.</p>

<p>Do not put whatever down your waste disposal unit. It is essential to view what you put down your waste disposal unit. Foods like rice and pasta can swell when blended with water, and possibly cause a clog. Vegetables and fruit peels can also trigger obstructions and jams - think about composting or placing these items in the garbage. Additionally, grease and oil can congeal and gather in your drain also. After finishing cooking, think about pouring remaining grease or oil into a container or bowl to reserve. You can then utilize and reheat for other cooking or easily location in the garbage after it's solidified.</p>

<p>The discharge tube included in the disposer set will be connected to the disposer utilizing the plate, gasket and screws originally intended for the disposer discharge elbow. If your package just consists of a waste arm, it is possible - though not advised - to connect this to the disposer discharge elbow utilizing a slip joint. The successive 90 Â° turns in such a setup can result in inappropriate drainage. Depending upon the length of the waste arm, you may have the ability to cut off its elbow and utilize the rest as a straight discharge tube.</p>

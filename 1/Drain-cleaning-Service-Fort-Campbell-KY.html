<p>Sometimes, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as simple as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he generates data on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's responsibility to understand what the field test information implies for that specific assembly.  When a qualified tester interprets the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>

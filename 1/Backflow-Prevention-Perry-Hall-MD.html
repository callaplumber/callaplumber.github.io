<p>In water circulation systems, water is usually kept at a substantial pressure to enable water to stream from the tap, shower, or other component. Water pressure may stop working or be decreased when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is unexpectedly high need on the water system (for example, when several fire hydrants are opened). Minimized pressure in the pipe might permit infected water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
<p>The most common method for producing soft water is through ion exchange, a procedure in which the calcium and magnesium in the water are exchanged for another element, normally sodium. Sodium won't cause lime scale or soap scum accumulation like other minerals do, and water softening adds just a really small amount of sodium to your water. According to the Mayo Clinic, an 8-ounce glass of soft water would have less than 12.5 milligrams of sodium, which is considered very low salt" by the Food and Drug Administration.</p>

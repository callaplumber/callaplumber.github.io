<p>As the water treatment market has actually grown in the U.S., the concept of water softening has actually frequently been misconstrued as a purifying, cleansing or conditioning process. This is due mostly to overstated marketing and, in part, to customer misunderstandings about water treatment. But the reality is that water softening just eliminates hardness minerals and eliminates problems that are a problem and not a danger to human health. The decision "to soften or not to soften" is a matter of personal preference not need. However, water softening does have benefits, and drawbacks, that make this decision a considerable one.</p>
<p>In some cases a clog can be caused due to buildup and grease within the system. If this is the case, snaking the drain will not fix the problem.

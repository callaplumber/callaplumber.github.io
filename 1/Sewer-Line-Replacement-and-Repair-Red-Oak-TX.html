Insert it back into the drain until you strike resistance once again, then turn the handle back and forth to work some of the clog free. Pull the auger out regularly to eliminate debris till it moves past the blockage without resistance.</p>

Products that would otherwise enter the garbage must not be placed in your disposal. This includes glass, plastic, metals (yes, flatware), paper, anything flammable, bleach, drain cleaners, and toys.</p>

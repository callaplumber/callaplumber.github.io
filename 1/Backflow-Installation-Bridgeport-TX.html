Once the system is pressurized, air must be eliminated from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system must be inspected to ensure no valves were accidentally left open or did not close effectively. Once the plumbing system is pressurized, make certain all valves are entirely open and alert the water user that the plumbing system has actually been gone back to service.</p>

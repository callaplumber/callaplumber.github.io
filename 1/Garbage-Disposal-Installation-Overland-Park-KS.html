<p>Gas is an essential energy we use every day to keep our workplaces and houses warm, our showers hot, and to cook our food. With the day-to-day usage of gas, it is easy to understand it is easy to understand that gradually a leak is bound to occur.

Keep in mind to take preventative measures when handling gas appliances, use the aforementioned signs to determine possible leaks, and call a plumber to have your gas lines regularly maintained and checked.</p>
<p>A. Normally wax does not "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Likewise, make certain the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undiscovered issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>

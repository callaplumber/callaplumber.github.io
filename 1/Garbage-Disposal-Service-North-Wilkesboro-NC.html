<p>The most effective method to attend to hard water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are collected by tiny resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When difficult water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and changed with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>6. Install the new sink flange, gasket and rings. All sinks (and toilets) have drain traps, referred to as P-traps, that keep sewer gas from entering your house. Plumbers can replace or fix blocked or leaking P-traps to keep them functioning appropriately. Leaking pipes can impact your indoor air quality.

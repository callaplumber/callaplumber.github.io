<p>A clogged drain can cause a catastrophic leak with time. Don't wait until it's far too late! Trust our water leak detection solutions to fix your home's problems. Cooking Grease: Cooking grease ought to never be tossed down the kitchen drain. While it might go down as a liquid, as it cools it can end up being strong, finish your pipes in the process. It still remains sticky, however, which allows it to draw in other debris, ultimately creating a huge blockage in your pipes.</p>
<p>The source or place of a sewer problem determines who pays for repair. The City is accountable for the public right-of-way (curb to curb), from one side of the street to another. The property owner is responsible for the area from the curb to the back of their residential or commercial property line. Easements (typically 10 feet wide) where main sewage systems traverse personal property are an exception to this rule.</p>
<p>In some households, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to method when searching for a practical service, particularly when easy plunging doesn't seem to work. However, there are many disadvantages to utilizing these harmful products - not least of which is that they typically include compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is triggering a blockage, which can vary from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, little items, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, however at the cost of providing the threat of damage to your home and family.</p>

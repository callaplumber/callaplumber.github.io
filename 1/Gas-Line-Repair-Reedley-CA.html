Simply put a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, include some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mix sit for a while. You can attempt a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner if that does not work. Much of these cleaners consist of concentrated levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be very hazardous if it is available in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. Please ensure to take the appropriate safety measures if using one of these items.</p>

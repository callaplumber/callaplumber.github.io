<p>Template-Assisted Condensation: Shortened to TAC, this method utilizes resin beads as a catalytic nucleation site where solidity mineral ions are become a steady crystalline kind that will not hold on to surfaces. These crystals are microscopic and circulation typically through the water. Unlike with a softener that uses ion-exchange, this tank of resin beads does not need ongoing regrowth.</p>
<p>Sooner or later, nevertheless, the beads reach maximum capacity and can't bring in anymore mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank must be regrowed, or, flushed clean. That's where the brine tank is available in. An on-board computer calculates the amount of water that streams through the softener. When it reaches the preprogrammed setting, regrowth automatically begins. For a three-bedroom home and household of 4, regrowth generally takes place every 12,000 gallons.</p>
<p>As the firmness in the water increases, so does the annual savings. In a 40-gpg difficult water market, salt cost savings alone can reach $1,144 per year. Many water looks alike - however inside a clear glass of water there thousands of liquified minerals which are entirely unnoticeable to your naked eye.

The repair may be as simple as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he generates data on the operations of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's duty to know what the field test information indicates for that specific assembly.  When a skilled tester interprets the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>

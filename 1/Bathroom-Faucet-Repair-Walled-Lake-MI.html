<h3>Lavatory Faucet Replacement in Walled Lake Michigan</h2>
<p>Depending on your scenario, your plumber may use one or a mix of piping material during your house repiping task. Copper is standard due to the fact that it's long-lasting, can survive fires, and withstands weather. However, copper is tough to install, which means greater labor expenses. PEX or polyethylene pipes have the advantage of flexibility, which means plumbers can flex the pipes eliminating the need for joints, which saves money and time and decreases the threat of joint leaks. PEX also resists deterioration and freezing better than metal pipes. Your residential plumbing company will choose which material is best depending upon your requirements.</p>

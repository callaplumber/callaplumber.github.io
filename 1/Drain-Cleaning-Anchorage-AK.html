<p>Agilent's series of leak detection solutions guarantee the safety, security and consistent performance of research study, vacuum, and industrial process systems. Examining the water meter is an excellent next step in your plumbing inspection. Close all faucets and inspect if the water meter is turning. If it is, there is a leak someplace and this might be major problem. Move on to the valves. Start with the main turned off valve operation. When turned off, no faucet in your house need to have water. This opts for every other shut off valve and their matching faucets. You are off to a great start if whatever is working correctly.</p>

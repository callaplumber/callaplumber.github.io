Sodium will not trigger lime scale or soap residue accumulation like other minerals do, and water softening includes just a very small amount of sodium to your water. According to the Mayo Clinic, an 8-ounce glass of soft water would have less than 12.5 milligrams of salt, which is thought about very low sodium" by the Food and Drug Administration.</p>

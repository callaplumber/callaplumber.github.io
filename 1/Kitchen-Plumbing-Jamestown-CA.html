<p>When pressure in a water system exceeds the pressure in the potable system supplying the makeup water, backpressure is developed. This can require the drinkable water to reverse its direction of flow through the cross-connection between the two systems. Possible impurities can then enter the safe and clean water supply. The very best method to decrease accumulation is have a professional flush it at least once a year. In some areas of Virginia, where the water is particularly difficult with high mineral content, you might need to flush the hot water heater regularly.</p>

When washing dishes, you'll most likely notification lower water pressure in the shower or. The best option is to replace your plumbing with new pipes that don't have buildup.</p>

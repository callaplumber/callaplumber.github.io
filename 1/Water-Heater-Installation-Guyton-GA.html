Due to being mostly farming in Montcalm and Ionia counties, some homeowners are setting up ROs to rid their water source of nitrates that are a product of farming waste.

<p>You reside in an older home. If your house is 50 years old or older and you've never ever replaced its pipes, there's a great chance that you'll need to have it done soon. Galvanized pipes were usually set up in houses of this age, and these types of pipes are understood to burst and corrode when they get old. You might need to add a grounded outlet to power the garbage disposal if you don't already have one if so. This normally includes anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the total cost of the waste disposal unit installation.</p>

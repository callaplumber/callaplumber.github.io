<p>Sewer linings can help to repair cracked pipes without needing to totally replace your sewer lines or destroy the area around them. Everyday usage ought to not cause a water softener to leak.

<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. They changed my kitchen faucet and included 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly leaked in the past if I turned off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was rather affordable. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was very pleased with their service.</p>

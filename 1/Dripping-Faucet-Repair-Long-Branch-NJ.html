<p>A partial reroute is generally a little scale repiping of several afflicted areas of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost efficient, it is possible to just abandon the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, walls and attics. Costing less than a full repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can accumulate in cost extremely quickly. This is the main reason we will suggest a full repipe in certain areas, based on our experience.</p>

<p>The function of the Plumbing Inspection Program is to ensure that all plumbing set up during building and construction of a brand-new or renovated structure is set up by well-informed artisans in accordance with appropriate codes. Wastewater is Flooding Your Sink - A flooding sink is the stock-image for clogged drains. When your sink is filling with water after you clean your hands, clean the dishes, or put flat soda in your sink, you generally understand your drain is clogged and requires cleaning.

Blockages in a fixture can cause destructive damage to your draining pipes system the longer they persist.</p>

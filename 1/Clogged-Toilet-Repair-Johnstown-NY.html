It was set up 7 years back, and it never ever drained this well. I selected this company due to the fact that they had terrific reviews and a reasonable cost, and although the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a huge, horrible mess on their hands (literally), and they did a great job tidying up after it too.</p>

<p>Waste Disposal Unit Installation Sick Of False Promises? Water circulates in the tank where tiny resin beads switch the calcium and magnesium in the water for the sodium or potassium they're holding. The beads function as a sponge, adsorbing the solidity minerals from your water. This procedure is referred to as ion exchange, and soft water is the result. When the resin beads have actually maxed out their ability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be charged (a procedure called regeneration). Throughout this procedure, the resin beads are washed with the highly concentrated saltwater solution (salt water) from the tank (made from the salt you contributed to the tank). The brine requires the calcium and magnesium ions to be launched from the beads and replaced with sodium or potassium ions.</p>

<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable water system pressure, or a mix of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in potable water supply pressure occur whenever the amount of water being utilized goes beyond the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>

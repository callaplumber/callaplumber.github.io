<p>Check Valve (DCV) - safe for use both inside and underground, DCVs are a bit more costly but are also extremely practical, as they can be installed horizontally or vertically. Video cameras work in finding buried septic systems or inspecting the condition of buried pipes to identify proper maintenance schedules or the level of needed repairs.

<p>Almost all softeners fall into one of two categories. Timed designs have programmable timeclocks that will regenerate on a fixed schedule and after that go back to service.

Demand-control designs, with either electrical and mechanical sensing units, typically regrow after a lot of gallons of water have been softened. If you have a changing water utilize schedule, such models are hassle-free.</p>

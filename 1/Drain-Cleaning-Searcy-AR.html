<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable water system pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can develop increases in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in drinkable water system pressure happen whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>

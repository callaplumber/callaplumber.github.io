<p>Salt Water Valve - Controls water flow in and out of salt tank. Functions automatic shut-off to avoid overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is almost certainly from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water material of LP or natural gas is really low.

For that reason when evaporated water ultimately falls as rain - it is soft.</p>

<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean water system pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in drinkable supply of water pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being used exceeds the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>

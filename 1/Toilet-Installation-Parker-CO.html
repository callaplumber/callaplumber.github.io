<p>Against this, there is some anecdotal evidence that specific magnetic and electromagnetic devices can be reliable in preventing scale development in tough water systems. It is extremely hard to evaluate such claims, which are practically never based on tests that are well enough described to allow others to evaluate them and to validate the results. While the lack of "scientific" evidence does not in itself invalidate a claim for the efficacy of a device, it needs to make one think twice to accept it without some assurance of efficiency.</p>

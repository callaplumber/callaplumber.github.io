<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable supply of water pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in potable supply of water pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being used exceeds the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>

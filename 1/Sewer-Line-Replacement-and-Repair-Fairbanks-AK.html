For instance, backflow at unrestrained cross connections (cross-connections are any prospective or actual connection in between the public water system and a source of contamination or pollution) can enable pollutants or toxins to get in the potable water system. Illness can arise from ingesting water that has actually been polluted due to backflow.</p>

<p>Reverse osmosis uses an applied pressure gradient across a semi permeable membrane to get rid of osmotic pressure and eliminate water molecules from the service with hardness ions. The membrane has pores large enough to admit water particles for passage; hardness ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ will not fit through the pores. The resulting soft supply of water is free of hardness ions with no other ions being included. Membranes are a type of water filter requiring regular cleaning or replacement maintenance.</p>
<p>You hear water dripping or running in the tank. A backflow occurs when water runs backward through your pipes and into the drinking water system.

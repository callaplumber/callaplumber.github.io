For an outdoor gas light or appliance whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can trigger a clog or can cause corrosion that obstructs the line. Just 4" of water pressure can be enough to block a gas line. Sound-- Over time sediment can build up in the bottom of your tank. This sediment eventually gets hard and removes from the capability of your water heater. This hardened sediment is likely the source of the sound.</p>
<p>Rusting and corrosion on the outside of the water heater, inlet pipes, or parts can indicate a possible issue with the hot water heater. If it is more than 6 or 7 years old, it can also mean the water heater is near the end of its life.

<p>Kitchen sinks are always vulnerable to blockages with food and grease being the significant culprits. They congeal to the piping walls if fats are put down the sink. Food follows the grease down the plumbing, connecting to the walls also. Even tree roots can produce severe drain blockages by twisting around pipes. Their crushing strength stops the water circulation, forcing plumbers to discover and repair the issue for regular house plumbing operations. You need your drain cleaned up before it leads to more damage and even costlier repairs if this is what is happening to your home.</p>

<p>When water is hard, it can clog pipes and soap will liquify in it less easily. Water softening can avoid these negative results. Gas is a colorless, odor-free fuel. As a security precaution, we include a chemical odorant called mercaptan that gives natural gas an odor typically connected with rotten eggs. This unique scent allows you to smell a prospective leak if it happens. If you suspect a leak, always leave.</p>
<p>Button Plumbing was great. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly dripped in the past if I shut off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was rather reasonable. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was incredibly pleased with their service.</p>

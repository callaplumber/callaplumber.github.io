<p>Light Blue = Minimized Pressure Zone - supply pressure pushes open the # 1 check and is minimized by the # 1 Check spring (for example, to 90 psi). This pressure distinction throughout the # 1 check valve preserves the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone rises toward the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, avoiding backflow (reverse motion of fluid).</p>

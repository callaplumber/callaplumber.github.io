<h3>Kitchen Plumbing in Sorrento Florida</h2>
<p>A partial reroute is generally a small scale repiping of several affected areas of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost effective, it is possible to only desert the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, ceilings and walls. Costing less than a full repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can add up in cost extremely rapidly. This is the main reason we will recommend a full repipe in certain communities, based upon our experience.</p>

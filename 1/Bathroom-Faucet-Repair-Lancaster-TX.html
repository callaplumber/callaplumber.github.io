<p>Sometimes, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as easy as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he produces information on the workings of the assembly.

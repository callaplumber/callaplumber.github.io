I picked this company because they had great evaluations and a reasonable rate, and although the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a huge, revolting mess on their hands (actually), and they did an excellent job tidying up after it also.</p>

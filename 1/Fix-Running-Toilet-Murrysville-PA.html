<p>The most reliable way to deal with hard water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are collected by tiny resin beads through a process called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When tough water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and changed with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>Domestic water that gets here to your Ohio home carries minerals that can trigger rust on metal parts and components. To avoid rust from rust, storage tanks are equipped with a bar made with magnesium called an anode rod. The rod secures the tank by drawing in destructive products. By having the anode rod inspected frequently and replaced as needed, you can double the life of your hot water heater.</p>

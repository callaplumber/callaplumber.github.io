<p>As soon as the hardware parts have been cleaned up and inspected and the rubber parts have actually been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their parts. Some components may have really tight tolerances that have to be kept. An essential thing to identify on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the part. The guide is an extremely crucial part of the style of each component. If the element is not repaired appropriately, the guide could limit the movement (rather than constant or direct) of the element, which might cause the element to not work to its capabilities.

For the most part the guides are limiting the travel of the part triggering lower test outcomes than what is required.</p>

<p>Aside from these 2 important parts, there are a myriad of small, possibly less vital things that can degrade or break. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will rust far more quickly. Continuous gross smells coming from the toilet can indicate you need a new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising effectively, you may need a brand-new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can burst and trigger a leak. If mishandled, tank lids can split and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed. While this will not affect the function of your toilet, it definitely does not do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by pointing out all the important things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a total fixture and every part needs to be in excellent shape for it to operate at its best.</p>

Hiring a licensed Montgomery County plumber is your first step; a plumber can diagnose the issue and repair it.</p>
<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. They changed my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly leaked in the previous if I turned off the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was rather sensible. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was very happy with their service.</p>

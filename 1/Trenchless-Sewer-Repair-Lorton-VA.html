Leakages can also happen if you bump into the softener and jostle it, pulling the fitting apart. To avoid this from taking place, install the system in a safe and stable  location. If you live in an earthquake-prone area of the nation, secure the softener so that if the structure begins moving, the softener doesn't tip over and rip out the plumbing. If your water softener is leaking during regrowth, you must wait till after the cycle is finished and after that inspected the system for fractures or broken fittings. You should also check to make certain your drain line is never blocked up with particles. A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener throughout regeneration and flood your basement or garage.</p>

With a patented chlorine generator, our exceptional systems also supply an automatic cleaning cycle.

<p>Deluge systems are developed so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems usually are installed in locations where the possibility of a severe fire condition is likely, such as aircraft garages. Water to the system is held back by the deluge valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire takes place, the detection system sends a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then enables water to release from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>

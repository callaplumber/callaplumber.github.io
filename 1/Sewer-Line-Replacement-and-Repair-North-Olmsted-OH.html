Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping comes in. This is an option to consider if you live in an older house - such as one developed pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular option for house plumbing for numerous decades, but steel eventually struggles with deterioration and lacks the sturdiness these days's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>

<p>Natural gas is the one we are most closely exposed to. This gas is used for heating our houses, for lightening our stoves, and for running appliances such as hot water heater. This gas is made of a hydrocarbon called methane, unofficially known as marsh gas or swamp gas. Methane is a naturally occurring gas that takes place in the earth's crust and is also sometimes formed by the rotting of raw materials like sewage or manure. As beneficial as this gas is, the functions that make this gas dangerous is its odorless and colorless nature, which makes it a quiet killer. However, to thwart off that hazard, mercaptans are added into gas, which provides it a rotten egg smell and makes it noticeable when leaking. Make sure to just rely on an utmost professional with your gas line repair in Richmond.</p>

<p>A partial reroute is essentially a little scale repiping of one or more affected locations of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost efficient, it is possible to only desert the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, ceilings and walls. Costing less than a full repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can accumulate in cost really rapidly.

While water overuse is a problem for your wallet, it's likewise a problem for the environment. Old-fashioned water softening systems that aren't saltless can use up to 25 gallons of water every day for their regeneration procedure. That's 700 gallons of water a month just to keep your water softener up and running.</p>
<p>Almost all softeners fall into one of two categories. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will regrow on a predetermined schedule and then return to service. Because they regenerate whether the resin requires it or not, these work well for homes that are on regular water-using cycles but will waste more water and salt. Demand-control designs, with either mechanical and electrical sensors, generally regrow after numerous gallons of water have actually been softened. Such models are practical if you have a rising and falling water use schedule.</p>

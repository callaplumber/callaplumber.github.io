<p>If you need a water softener is a personal preference, identifying. Water softener systems work by removing hardness minerals and changing them with salt ions. Water conditioners are gadgets that help avoid the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They use a physical media to hinder the scale from developing by reducing the effects of the solidity itself. Due to the fact that water conditioners utilize a physical media instead of a chemical media, they are in some cases considered a greener option in locations where it is forbidden to use salt. Water conditioners do not efficiently eliminate solidity from the water supply, however, as the only method to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>

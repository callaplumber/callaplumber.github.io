<p>Backflow implies the unwanted turnaround of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the drinkable water system; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from occurring. Points at which a drinkable water system gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they must be carefully created and installed to avoid backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>

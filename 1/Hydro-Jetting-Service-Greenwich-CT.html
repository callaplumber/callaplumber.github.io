<h3>Things To Consider Before Hiring A Plumber Greenwich CT</h3>
<p>As the water treatment industry has actually grown in the U.S., the idea of water softening has often been misunderstood as a purifying, cleaning or conditioning process. This is due mostly to overstated marketing and, in part, to customer mistaken beliefs about water treatment. However the reality is that water softening merely gets rid of hardness minerals and gets rid of problems that are a problem and not a danger to human health. The choice "to soften or not to soften" refers individual choice not necessity. However, water softening does have benefits, and downsides, that make this decision a considerable one.</p>
<p>The cost to replace pipes under your home is simply the cost to install a brand-new plumbing system which can range from $2,000 to $15,000 or more. You can install brand-new copper pipes for $3 to $8 per linear foot, or $0.40 to $0.50 per linear foot for PEX hose. Pipes do run under houses, often times in concrete. It is quite common to leave the old pipes in location after disconnecting them. The new pipe is merely set up in the path of least resistance. Depending on the design of your house, the pipe can be installed in the attic or under a crawl area.</p>

The repair might be as easy as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he produces information on the workings of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's task to know what the field test information suggests for that particular assembly.  When an experienced tester interprets the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>

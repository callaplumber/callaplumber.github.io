<p>A. Usually wax does not "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Also, ensure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" undetected issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>

The activation of a faucet needing hot water triggers the heater and water is heated as it streams through a heating coil or heat exchanger. Because they can hinder the blades, cooking oil and other greases must never be put down the garbage disposal. Last but not least, cold water must be running when the garbage disposal is on and should continue to run for 30 seconds after the disposal is shut off to make sure that all food particles have been rinsed through the pipes.</p>

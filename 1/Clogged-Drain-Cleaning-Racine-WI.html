<p>A rule of thumb is that you can regain the cost of the repair if the problems takes place well outside that 8 to 12 year life-span. If, say, you need a brand-new burner kit and the hot water heater is 5 years old, then it makes good sense for you to invest the $120 for the part, specifically if you can do the work yourself. The closer the home appliance is to that 8 to 12-year limit, the more doubtful the economics of a repair ends up being. The reason is that some other part on the device will go or its tank will leak. And there's no cure for a leaking tank.</p>

<p>If you have actually constantly resided in an area with tough water, you might not realize just how much it affects you-- but if you've just recently moved from an area with soft water, you're likely all too aware of the dry, inflamed skin and frizzy, dull hair that can arise from difficult water.

Difficult water likewise makes it more difficult to wash soap off your body, or hair shampoo out of your hair, which can result in dandruff and itching of your skin or scalp.

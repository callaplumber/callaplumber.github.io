<h3>Pipe Cleaning in Waterloo New York</h2>
<p>In 1939, after his Roto-Rooter sewer cleaning machine proved successful, Sam Blanc designed and constructed a smaller sized model that ran on the same concept but might clean and clear bathroom and kitchen sink drains as well as laundry drains and other household plumbing drains. Blanc likewise developed a much bigger version of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It needed to be towed by a truck and included a 10 hp gas engine and 1000 feet of steel cable. It was capable of cleaning large industrial and local sewer pipes. An enhanced version called "The Mainliner" was introduced in 1958 that might also thread telephone cable. It was ceased in 1973.</p>

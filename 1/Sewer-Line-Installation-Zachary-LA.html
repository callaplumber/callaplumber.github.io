<p>Changing your sink is a step-by-step process. Step, cut, and link the pipes. Prior to attaching any pipes to your water softener, measure and cut your pipes to fit.

<p>When the hardware parts have actually been cleaned up and checked and the rubber parts have actually been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their elements.

Most of the times the guides are restricting the travel of the part triggering lower test outcomes than what is required.</p>

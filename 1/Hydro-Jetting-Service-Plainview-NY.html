<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, efficient, and a great person. He informed me precisely what to expect (cost, time, procedure) in advance and delivered as guaranteed. I will certainly utilize Clog Dawg again. Setting up a waste disposal unit takes 2 to 3 hours with a typical hourly rate of $25 to $70. These costs are in addition to the cost of the disposal system. If your plumber has a minimum callout charge that is greater than the labor cost for the work, the overall you pay might be higher.</p>
<p>Roto-Rooter's plumbers are professionals in sink repair and are prepared to fix your clogged sink or carry out a sink installation to satisfy your requirements. There's typically confusion about whether National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) requirements require backflow preventers on fire security systems. Let's be clear: they do not.

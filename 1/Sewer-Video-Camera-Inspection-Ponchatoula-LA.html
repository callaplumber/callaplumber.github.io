Some toilets, however, have actually uniquely shaped bowls and require a specific seat, like the Eljer Symbol. It truly isn't a good idea to utilize a toilet seat that is either much too big or much to small, unless they have been particularly created to fit normal toilets, as the toilet seat can wobble and cause you to slide around, or won't distribute your weight uniformly and might eventually trigger fractures in the bowl.</p>

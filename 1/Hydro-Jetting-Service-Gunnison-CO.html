With toilets, the pro will examine water levels, flappers, and filler systems. He or she will eyeball visible pipes, and might run a camera inspection to inspect the pipes' condition from the within.</p>
<p>When used in fighting a fire, fire department connections can be a concern. Firemen by and large are not interested in backflow prevention issues. They are interesting in securing individuals's lives and to a lesser level their home. Getting the necessary volume of water on a fire is their objective and they will utilize water from any source available to accomplish that goal. This can create cross-connection control problems and may as a result indicate that the level of security on the fire defense system might need to be increased to a high hazard defense level.</p>

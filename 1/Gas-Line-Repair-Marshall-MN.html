<p>An overall repipe of a house's water supply, frequently done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most detailed and costly plumbing task, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company concentrating on entire house repiping. For an outdoor gas light or appliance whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can trigger a blockage or can cause rust that blocks the line. Simply 4" of water pressure can be enough to obstruct a gas line. Noise-- Gradually sediment can develop in the bottom of your tank. This sediment eventually gets difficult and takes away from the capability of your hot water heater. This hardened sediment is most likely the source of the noise.</p>

<p>Examining the age, condition, and water lines to the hot water heater can assist plumbers understand numerous things, including water pressure and signs of leakages.

<p>Your house's drainage works by the basic force of gravity. When you flush water and waste down your sink or shower (and your toilets too) it's not truly the flow of water pressing them down your pipes.

Anything you put down there won't go through when something obstructs the pipes.</p>

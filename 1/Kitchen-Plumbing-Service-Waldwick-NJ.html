<h3>Experts In Plumbing, Heating, Cooling & Electrical Services Waldwick NJ</h3>
<p>These people were fantastic! They showed up early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been a problem off and on for many years now. It was installed 7 years ago, and it never drained this well. I picked this company because they had fantastic reviews and a reasonable price, and despite the fact that the task took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a big, disgusting mess on their hands (literally), and they did a great job cleaning up after it also.</p>

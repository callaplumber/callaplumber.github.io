<p>Permanent magnetic water conditioning devices have actually been marketed based on a range of claims concerning their impact on water firmness and related scale development. The Water Quality Association, a not-for-profit trade association for the water treatment market, has actually not been able to figure out requirements for these items and report irregular performance to date.

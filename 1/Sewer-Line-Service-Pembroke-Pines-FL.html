<p>A partial reroute is essentially a small scale repiping of one or more afflicted areas of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost reliable, it is possible to only desert the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, attics and walls. Costing less than a complete repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can add up in cost very rapidly.

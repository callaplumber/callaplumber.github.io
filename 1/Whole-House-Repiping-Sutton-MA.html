<p>It is common for hot water heater to leak due to varying pressure, and the temperature level and pressure relief valve belongs to the unit for that specific reason. But while small drips ought to not be cause for issue, homeowners need to watch on the water heater leaks. When we needed a leak in a pipe repaired, I had a great experience with Gotelli Plumbing. Tom was friendly and professional. He also did the job faster than original estimated, so the work was less costly than I anticipated. I will utilize Gotelli Plumbing once again in the future.</p>

All gas piping setups need a license and inspection.</p>

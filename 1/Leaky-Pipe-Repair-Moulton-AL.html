<p>No, you need to NOT put caustic chemical drain cleaners down your drains if you're serious about safeguarding your drain and plumbing system. The reason is that these chemical cleaners can be much more harmful than useful, potentially gnawing at your pipes.

Whether you require help with a small repair, a remodel or a re-pipe, you can ensure that the work will be finished the very first time properly.

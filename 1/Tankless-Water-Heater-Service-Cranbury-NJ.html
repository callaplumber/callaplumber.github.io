<p>To determine if your home is a poly home," start with the exterior. Underground water mains are typically blue in color (they can also be black or gray). The pipe is usually 1/2 to 1-inch in diameter. Regularly, it enters the home near the water heater. Your main turned off is attached to completion of the water pipe. Make certain you check both ends of the pipe. We have actually discovered cases where the copper pipe goes into the home and polybutylene is at the meter.</p>
<p>Water treated with a water softener system may not only save customers money but might also be environmentally friendly, since it helps cut down on harmful detergents going into water streams.

<p>Surface Area Accelerated Formation is an invention that mimics biomineralization, the system frequently acknowledged for structured growth in the environment, consisting of seashells.

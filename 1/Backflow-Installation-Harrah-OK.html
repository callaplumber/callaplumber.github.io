<p>This is among the main and first concerns that you must ask yourself when it comes to repiping and replacing plumbing in your house.

If your house was built before the 1970s, we highly encourage that you work with a plumbing professional to inspect your home's plumbing and check if there are areas that need repiping. Possibilities are that your house might need substantial repiping so that your house's plumbing can operate at optimal rates if your house was developed years before that.</p>

<p>Keep in mind: Hard water stops your washing detergent from working efficiently because difficult water ions can bond with cleaning agent particles to deactivate them. You, for that reason, need to use a growing number of detergent to accomplish the exact same cleaning power. The media gets a bath in the salt option.

Lastly, water consisting of the difficult minerals and other waste gets flushed out of the system.</p>

For residential property, it is essential for owners to alert the District if any modifications are made, such as digging a new well. For commercial home, the District evaluates making use of each new tenant. The correction must be made before water service is allowed if the present backflow is not up to District code. Cost for the device is covered by either the renter or the home owner.</p>
<p>Sometimes, an inexperienced individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as basic as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he creates information on the functions of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's task to know what the field test information means for that specific assembly.  When a skilled tester analyzes the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>

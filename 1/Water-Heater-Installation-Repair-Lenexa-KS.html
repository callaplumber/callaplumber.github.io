<p>Backflow means the unfavorable turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the safe and clean water system; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from occurring. Points at which a safe and clean water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, but they should be carefully designed and set up to avoid backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>

For a three-bedroom house and household of 4, regrowth typically happens every 12,000 gallons.</p>

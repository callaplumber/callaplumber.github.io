Even bushes and trees can trigger problems for sewer lines, specifically in older communities where clay pipe may have been utilized. In the cold Colorado winters, pipes can break from frozen ground, which can be twice as intensified if pipes have been enabled to freeze.</p>

If you have actually tried to unclog a bathroom or kitchen sink without any luck, it might be time to call a professional plumber. They can identify the location of the blockage and the best methods to unclog the traffic jam without hurting your plumbing.</p>

<p>In some cases, an inexperienced individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as easy as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he creates data on the functions of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's responsibility to know what the field test information indicates for that specific assembly.  When an experienced tester analyzes the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>

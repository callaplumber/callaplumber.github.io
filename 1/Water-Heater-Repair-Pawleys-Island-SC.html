<p>Versus this, there is some anecdotal evidence that specific magnetic and electromagnetic devices can be effective in avoiding scale development in difficult water systems. It is extremely challenging to judge such claims, which are almost never based upon tests that are well sufficient described to permit others to assess them and to validate the outcomes.

<p>Domestic water that arrives to your Ohio home carries minerals that can cause rust on metal parts and components. To avoid corrosion from rust, storage tanks are equipped with a bar made with magnesium called an anode rod. The rod protects the tank by attracting destructive materials.

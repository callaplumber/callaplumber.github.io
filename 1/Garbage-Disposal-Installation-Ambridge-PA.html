<p>When figuring out the solidity of water, there are ranges of grains per gallon (gpg). Rinckey stated that both Belding and Greenville city water steps around 18 gpg, which is considered exceptionally tough water, leaving telltale signs like spotty glasses and soap residue that is next to impossible to remove. With well water, these signs might also be coupled with iron spots and sulfur-smells originating from the tap.</p>

<p>The U-shaped pipe below bathroom and kitchen sinks is something that people expect to see but rarely stop to consider. The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you flip the switch, however it does not grind up food, this implies the flywheel is stuck.

At the same time, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom handle (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>
<p>A garbage disposal need to not leak. It generally suggests wear and tear which is a reasonable sign that its time is up when this happens. If you think of what you put down the disposal, leaks can be unclean and will likewise eventually trigger stress on other parts of your waste disposal unit.

For a leak in the drain pipe, you may need to fill the sink with water before analyzing the pipe underneath.</p>

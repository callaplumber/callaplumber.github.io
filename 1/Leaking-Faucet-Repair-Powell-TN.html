<p>All piping under faucets and sinks are looked for leakages or damage. How to inform if you have polybutylene pipes: If your pipes are white plastic and include the letters PB" in the printed label, you have polybutylene pipes and we recommend having them replaced immediately. Before you can ask for an inspection, you should first acquire the required authorization( s) for the work you mean to do. You can take a look at our License page for additional information on getting a permit. As soon as you get an authorization you can begin with the work. However, you need to require inspection prior to you conceal any work or cover.</p>

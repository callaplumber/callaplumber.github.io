Running a video camera through the household sewer pipes (generally from your home to its connection to the public sewer system) can be utilized to evaluate the type and condition of underground pipes, and to identify problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, clogs, rust or collapsed pipes. Homeowners may have a video inspection done to discover the cause of periodic sewer backups or other ongoing problems, or when selling or buying an older house.</p>

<h3>Drain Clean Out in Northport New York</h2>
<p>Leaky faucets and clogged drains are the most common sink repair problems. Common enough that many people opt for do-it-yourself repairs. However sometimes even identifying the leak can be a problem. It might be the shutoff valve, the faucet, a spray hose, garbage disposal fittings, the edge of the sink itself, or any part of the drain-- tailpiece, extension tube, slip extension, elbows, T joints, or the U or J trap.</p>
<p>Plumbers install and repair water, gas, and other piping systems in services, factories, and homes. They install plumbing components, such as toilets and tubs, and home appliances, such as dishwashing machines and water heaters. They clean drains, get rid of obstructions, and repair or replace broken pipes and fixtures. Plumbers also help maintain septic tanks-- big, underground holding tanks that collect waste from houses that are not linked to a sewer system.</p>
<p>Deluge systems are created so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems normally are set up in areas where the possibility of a serious fire condition is likely, such as aircraft garages. Water to the system is kept back by the deluge valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire takes place, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then permits water to discharge from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>

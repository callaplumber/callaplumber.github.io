PEX also withstands deterioration and freezing better than metal pipes. Your residential plumbing company will choose which material is best depending upon your needs.</p>

<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always dripped in the past. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was quite reasonable. I will certainly utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was extremely happy with their service.</p>

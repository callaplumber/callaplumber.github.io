<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable water system pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable water system pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can create boosts in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Decreases in safe and clean water system pressure take place whenever the amount of water being utilized exceeds the amount of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water mains.</p>

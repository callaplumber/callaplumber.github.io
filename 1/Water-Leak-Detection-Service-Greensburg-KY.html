To avoid this, ensure the brand-new waste disposal unit installation kit consists of a tube, or purchase one separately at the exact same time for about $3.</p>
<p>Keeping your garbage dispoal clean isn't extremely hard or time consuming. Fill the sink at least half full of soapy water. Remove the stopper from the drain while at the same time switching on the disposal. This will fill the entire disposal with soapy water and aid to eliminate food accumulation.

<h3>Emergency Plumbing Tips For Your Everyday Plumber Lebanon NH</h3>
<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable water supply pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can develop increases in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in safe and clean water system pressure occur whenever the amount of water being utilized goes beyond the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>

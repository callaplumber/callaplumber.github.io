These obstructions could have been made from grease, heavy sludge, or tree roots that have developed with time. Hydro jetting's sophisticated technology permits the process to be quick and efficient.

<p>Kitchen sinks are always vulnerable to obstructions with food and grease being the major culprits. If fats are put down the sink, they harden to the piping walls. Food follows the grease down the plumbing, attaching to the walls too. Even tree roots can develop severe drain blockages by wrapping around pipes. Their crushing strength stops the water circulation, requiring plumbers to discover and repair the issue for regular house plumbing operations. If this is what is occurring to your house, you need your drain cleaned up before it results in more damage and even more expensive repairs.</p>

<p>The very best source for this type of plumber is a general contractor. The contractor sees the plumber's work before it's concealed; you do not get that opportunity.

A simple mistake-- a joint left unsoldered or a leaky PVC line-- can quickly ravage $10,000 worth of walls or wood floorings and complicate the job with insurance coverage claims, wasted time, and lawsuits. With so much riding on the plumber, contractors tend to stick to just the very best.</p>

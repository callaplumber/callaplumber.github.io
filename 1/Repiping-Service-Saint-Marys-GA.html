<p>The source or location of a sewer issue identifies who pays for repair. The City is responsible for the general public right of way (curb to curb), from one side of the street to another. The property owner is responsible for the area from the curb to the back of their residential or commercial property line. Easements (usually 10 feet broad) where main sewers pass through personal property are an exception to this rule.</p>

This is in addition to any interior gas lines or extensions that need to be set up.

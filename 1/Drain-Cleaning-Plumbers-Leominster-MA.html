<p>The individual who does the testing must be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this accreditation, and a plumbing license is not needed to acquire this certification. I have actually checked with a couple of plumbers, and the prices quoted for backflow testing varied from $150 - $250, but I would expect the price to be significantly less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>
<h3>Toilet Replacement in Leominster Massachusetts</h2>
<p>Your old discharge tube most likely won't be the right length for your new disposal. If it's too long, simply link it to the disposal, mark it and cut it with a hacksaw for your waste disposal unit installation. (Loosen up the other pipe connections, if essential, to insert television back into the tee.) You may have to make a time-wasting trip to the shop if the old discharge tube is too brief. To avoid this, make certain the brand-new waste disposal unit installation package consists of a tube, or buy one independently at the exact same time for about $3.</p>
<p>The Plumbing Inspection Department is responsible for protecting the water supply by ensuring, through plan evaluation and inspections, that the plumbing has no cross-connections or possibility of backflow.

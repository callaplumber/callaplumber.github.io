Considering that these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like traditional water softeners do, one advantage claimed for the user is the removal of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant growth promotion have actually been declared, such systems do not eliminate minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only change the downstream effects that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have.

<p>When you hear the words whole-house repiping, you may be worried. It seems like a huge job. It is-- but this is why you employ professional plumbers to do the work.

<p>Plumbers repair and install water, gas, and other piping systems in factories, houses, and businesses.

Plumbers also help preserve septic systems-- big, underground holding tanks that collect waste from houses that are not linked to a sewer system.</p>
<p>Many normal single family home systems will not require supply piping bigger than 3⁄4 inch (19 mm) due to expenditure in addition to steel piping's tendency to end up being obstructed from internal rusting and mineral deposits forming on the inside of the pipe gradually once the internal galvanizing zinc covering has actually degraded. In potable water circulation service, galvanized steel pipe has a service life of about 30 to 50 years, although it is not unusual for it to be less in geographical areas with destructive water contaminants.</p>

<h2>Tips To Hire Affordable Plumbing Service in Lexington</h2>

<p>The U-shaped pipe underneath kitchen and bathroom sinks is something that individuals expect to see but rarely stop to think about. The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you turn the switch, but it doesn't grind up food, this indicates the flywheel is stuck. Try freeing the jam by placing a hex wrench of the appropriate size into the hole on the bottom of the waste disposal unit. At the same time, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom handle (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>
<p>The secret to preventing a clogged garbage disposal is moderation. As long as the food waste is sent out through the disposal at a reasonable quantity, there must be no issue in getting most of the waste through. There are a few food items you should most likely not take into the garbage disposal though. Those items are coffee grounds, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another pointer to stop clogging is to watch out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will harden when they cool so it is best to clean pots and pans that have those liquids under warm water and to continue to let the water run for several seconds after you are finished cleaning to make sure the drain is clear.</p>

As difficult water goes through the mineral tank, the beads inside attract the positively-charged calcium and magnesium ions. The minerals that trigger tough water adhere to the beads, and the treated water goes out into your house's plumbing system.</p>

The repair may be as basic as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he generates data on the operations of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's duty to know what the field test information suggests for that specific assembly.  When a skilled tester translates the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>

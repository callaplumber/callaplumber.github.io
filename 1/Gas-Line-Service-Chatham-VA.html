<h3>Most Common Residential Plumbing Emergencies Chatham VA</h3>
<p>These men were amazing! They showed up early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been a problem off and on for several years now.

I picked this company due to the fact that they had fantastic reviews and a reasonable rate, and although the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a big, disgusting mess on their hands (literally), and they did a terrific task cleaning up after it as well.</p>

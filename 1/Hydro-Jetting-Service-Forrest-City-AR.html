<p>When a flush valve causes a toilet to run, a worn flapper is generally the offender. But not constantly. Initially, take a look at the chain that raises the flapper. If there's excessive slack in the chain, it can tangle up and avoid the flapper from closing firmly. A chain with insufficient slack can trigger trouble too. Photo 3 demonstrates how to set the slack just right.</p>
<p>For instance, if your hot water heater is continuously breaking down and requiring repair, a new system will conserve you money. Furthermore, if you observe increasing energy expenses from an ineffective system, you will also conserve money with a new installation. We recommend that all water heaters that are 10-15 years old be changed in order to save the property owner money and time in the future.</p>

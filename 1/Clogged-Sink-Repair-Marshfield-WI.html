<p>The trick to avoiding a clogged garbage disposal is moderation. As long as the food waste is sent out through the disposal at a sensible amount, there need to be no issue in getting the majority of the waste through. There are a few food items you must probably not take into the garbage disposal though. Those products are coffee premises, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another idea to stop blocking is to keep an eye out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will harden when they cool so it is best to wash pots and pans that have those liquids under hot water and to continue to let the water run for several seconds after you are finished cleaning to ensure the drain is clear.</p>

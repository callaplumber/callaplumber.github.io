You, therefore, have to utilize increasingly more cleaning agent to achieve the very same cleaning power. The media gets a bath in the salt service. Tough minerals captured in the resin (or zeolite) are launched and the media gets renewed with salt ions. The water softener is also cleaned and sanitized throughout regeneration. Lastly, water including the difficult minerals and other waste gets eliminated of the system.</p>

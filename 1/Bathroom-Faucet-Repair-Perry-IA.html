Such connections happen naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they should be carefully designed and set up to prevent backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>

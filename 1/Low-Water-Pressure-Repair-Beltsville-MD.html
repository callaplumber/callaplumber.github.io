<p>Salt Water Valve - Controls water flow in and out of salt tank. Functions automatic shut-off to avoid overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is likely from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water content of LP or gas is very low. Rainwater which has not filtered through the earth is an exceptionally pure type of water. When water vaporizes it leaves behind liquified solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. For that reason when vaporized water eventually falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
<p>Water supplied by the water company includes some quantities of damaging chemicals like arsenic and lead. Water filtration systems remove these impurities to make drinking water clean, clear and tastier. As such, water filtration systems are important requirements, not optional expenditures. A home plumbing inspection will either be visual, made with a camera, or a combination of both.</p>

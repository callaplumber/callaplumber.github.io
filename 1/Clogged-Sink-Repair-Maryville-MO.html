Just 4" of water pressure can be enough to block a gas line. Noise-- With time sediment can develop in the bottom of your tank. This sediment eventually gets difficult and takes away from the capability of your water heater. This solidified sediment is most likely the source of the noise.</p>

<p>A. Normally wax does not "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from below the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Likewise, ensure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" unnoticed problem. Attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>You live in an older house. If your house is 50 years old or older and you have actually never replaced its pipes, there's a good chance that you'll need to have it done soon. Galvanized pipes were frequently set up in homes of this age, and these kinds of pipes are known to burst and corrode when they get old. You might need to include a grounded outlet to power the garbage disposal if you do not already have one if so. This typically adds anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the general cost of the waste disposal unit installation.</p>
<p>Kitchen sinks are always susceptible to clogs with food and grease being the major offenders. They congeal to the piping walls if fats are poured down the sink. Food follows the grease down the plumbing, attaching to the walls also. Even tree roots can produce severe drain clogs by twisting around pipes. Their crushing strength stops the water flow, forcing plumbers to repair the problem and discover for regular home plumbing operations. If this is what is taking place to your home, you need your drain cleaned prior to it causes more damage and even costlier repairs.</p>

Repiping is the replacement of either a single pipe or a house's whole plumbing system, consisting of both supply of water and drain lines.

Low water pressure could be due to a wide variety of factors, but the most typical factors are sediment accumulation and rust, which both obstruct water from going through the entire pipe and put unwanted pressure on specific areas of pipe.</p>
<p>Deluge systems are designed so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems normally are set up in areas where the possibility of a serious fire condition is likely, such as airplane hangars. Water to the system is held back by the deluge valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire takes place, the detection system sends a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then permits water to discharge from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>

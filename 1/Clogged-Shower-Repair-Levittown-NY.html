<p>A camera inspection takes the uncertainty out of sewer and drain maintenance. Plus, it avoids the need to collect your backyard. During a camera inspection, a sewer and drain technician runs a video cable down sewer branch lines that lead from bath tubs, sinks, and other drains into the main sewer line. Using the images captured by the camera, we can determine any sewer and drain line problems, such as blockages, tree root intrusion, misaligned joints, fractures, and other damage.</p>
<p>While you can fix some toilet problems yourself, many are tough or point to more complicated concerns than what you see on the surface area. Do It Yourself toilet repairs are not the best option if you have an older toilet, a leak, or a possible issue with your pipes. If you need to repeatedly plunge a toilet, you may unknowingly worsen a pipe problem. There are too many things that can go wrong with DIY and quick repairs. It's constantly best to call in a professional plumber for toilet repairs and replacements.</p>

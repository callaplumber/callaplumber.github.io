<h3>Most Common Residential Plumbing Emergencies Wingate NC</h3>
<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's drinkable water supply.

Pumps can produce boosts in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in potable water supply pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being utilized exceeds the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water pipe.</p>

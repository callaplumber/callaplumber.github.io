<p>As a locally-owned organisation, integrity and duty are exceptionally crucial to developing a credibility for excellence.

These BFP's, if testable, are needed to be checked (by a certified backflow preventer tester) upon installation and at least every twelve months afterwards.</p>
<p>Don't put whatever down your waste disposal unit. It is very important to enjoy what you put down your garbage disposal. Foods like rice and pasta can swell when mixed with water, and potentially cause a clog. Vegetables and fruit peels can also trigger clogs and jams - consider composting or putting these items in the garbage. In addition, grease and oil can gather and harden in your drain too. After finishing cooking, consider pouring remaining grease or oil into a container or bowl to set aside. You can then reheat and use for other cooking or quickly place in the garbage after it's solidified.</p>

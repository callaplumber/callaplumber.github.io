<p>In water circulation systems, water is generally maintained at a substantial pressure to allow water to stream from the tap, shower, or other fixture. Water pressure may fail or be lowered when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is all of a sudden high need on the water system (for instance, when several fire hydrants are opened). Reduced pressure in the pipe might permit contaminated water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and added 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always leaked in the previous. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was quite sensible. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was super pleased with their service.</p>

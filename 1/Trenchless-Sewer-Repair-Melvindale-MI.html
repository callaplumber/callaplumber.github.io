<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable water supply pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can create boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in safe and clean water system pressure occur whenever the amount of water being utilized exceeds the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water pipe.</p>

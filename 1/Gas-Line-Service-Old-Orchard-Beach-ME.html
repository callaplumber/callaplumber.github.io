<p>A total repipe of a home's water system, typically done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most intricate and pricey plumbing task, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company specializing in whole house repiping. For an outdoor gas light or device whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can trigger a blockage or can trigger corrosion that blocks the line. Just 4" of water pressure can be enough to obstruct a gas line. Noise-- With time sediment can build up in the bottom of your tank. This sediment eventually gets hard and eliminates from the capability of your water heater. This solidified sediment is likely the source of the noise.</p>

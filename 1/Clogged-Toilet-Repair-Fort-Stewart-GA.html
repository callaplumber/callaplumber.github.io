<p>A lowered pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is set up in high risk" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has 2 spring checks, however also has a third check valve that is in fact a vent open to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is used in high-risk circumstances is since if the very first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains. This relief valve offers an extra layer of security compared to the DC, which will enable backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the factor that when you check an RPZ, you force water to backflow to make sure the RPZ discharges.</p>

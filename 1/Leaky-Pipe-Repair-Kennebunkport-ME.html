<p>Backflow means the unwanted reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the drinkable water system; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from occurring. Points at which a drinkable water system gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they must be thoroughly developed and installed to prevent backflow. Another typical location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>

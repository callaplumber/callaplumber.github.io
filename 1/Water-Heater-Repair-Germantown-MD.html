<p>Supply of water by the public utility includes some amounts of hazardous chemicals like arsenic and lead.

A home plumbing inspection will either be visual, finished with a camera, or a combination of both.</p>
<p>The Plumbing Bureau's main focus is on safety within a structure. Plumbing inspections make sure that water supply in buildings are linked effectively, without any cross-connection to pollute potable water supply. Components need to be properly caught, to prevent sewer gas from getting away into a buildings. Warm water heaters are also inspected to ensure that they have been installed correctly, to prevent an explosion.</p>
<p>In some cases, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as easy as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he generates data on the workings of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's responsibility to know what the field test information suggests for that specific assembly.  When an experienced tester translates the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>

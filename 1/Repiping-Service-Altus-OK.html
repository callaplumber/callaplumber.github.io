<p>Water softening utilizes a process called "ion exchange" to get rid of dissolved hard water minerals such as calcium, manganese, iron and magnesium. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular response is required. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto sodium, and as the tough water streams through the resin, the salt is swapped for the hard water minerals. The tough water minerals are caught in the softener and a trace quantity of salt flows out with the softened water.</p>
<p>The California Code of Laws, Title 17, mandates water purveyors, such as EBMUD, to administer a cross-connection control prevention program, which helps keep safe and clean water from contaminant and toxin direct exposure.

<p>A. The toilet fill valve measurements we show are determined from the inside bottom of the tank to the top of the fill valve. The threaded supply of water shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not consisted of in this measurement. The addition of a backflow preventer decreases water service pressure to the structure; extra, more significant expenses can take place if the drop in water pressure becomes a concern for citizens. If setting up a pump or larger size water service and backflow prevention device would combat the pressure loss, a PE or RA can assist identify.</p>
<p>If your flapper valve has a ball that floats at the end of a rod, gently lift the rod and listen. You may be able to stop the running by adjusting the float if the water shuts off. Some fill toilet valves have a float change screw on top (see Figure A below). If there is no adjustment screw, flex the float arm. Make sure it's adjusted properly (Image 8)if you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve. You do not need to empty the tank to make these modifications.</p>

<p>An overall repipe of a house's water system, typically done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most intricate and costly plumbing job, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company specializing in entire house repiping. Current Review: Carlos and Lopez were amazing. My 90 year old Dad's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos arrived at 8am the next day to repair. Due to the fact that of the age of the house and place of the pipe, it was a challenging task. They worked for nearly 12 hours into darkness to ensure the system was working before they left. I am genuinely grateful for their effort and professionalism.</p>

<p>Replacing your sink is a step-by-step process. Step, cut, and link the pipes. Before attaching any pipes to your water softener, step and cut your pipes to fit. If you are using copper pipes, solder on any nipples and fittings prior to linking the unit to the bypass valve to avoid melting the plastic. Seal all threads with plumber's tape. Plastic tubing like PEX can also be used.

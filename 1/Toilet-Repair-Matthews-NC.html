Because these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like traditional water softeners do, one advantage claimed for the user is the elimination of the need to include salt to the system. While particle size decrease and plant growth promotion have actually been declared, such systems do not eliminate minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only modify the downstream impacts that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of particular systems has actually shown a decrease of calcium scale formation. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>

If this stain is an inconvenience in your house, the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) recommends changing to one of the other two kinds of salts. As soon as the brand-new salt has had an opportunity to entirely replace the solar salt in your system, then buy some water softener filter cleaner to clear out your softener as advised in your owner's handbook or on the cleaner label.</p>

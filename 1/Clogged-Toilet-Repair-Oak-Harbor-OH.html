<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable water supply pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can create boosts in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in safe and clean water system pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being utilized exceeds the amount of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water mains.</p>

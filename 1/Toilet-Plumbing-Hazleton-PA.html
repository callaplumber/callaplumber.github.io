<p>When the hardware parts have actually been cleaned and checked and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their parts. Some components may have really tight tolerances that have to be maintained. A crucial thing to recognize on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the part. The guide is a very vital part of the design of each component. If the part is not repaired correctly, the guide might limit the movement (instead of consistent or direct) of the part, which could cause the component to not work to its abilities.

In many cases the guides are restricting the travel of the element causing lower test results than what is needed.</p>

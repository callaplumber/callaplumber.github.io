<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the incoming potable supply of water. Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature level increases in boilers, or if there is a decline in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when unfavorable or lower pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, typically due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A common type of backflow preventer is the lowered pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>

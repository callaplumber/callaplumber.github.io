<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable water system pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in drinkable water supply pressure take place whenever the amount of water being utilized exceeds the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>

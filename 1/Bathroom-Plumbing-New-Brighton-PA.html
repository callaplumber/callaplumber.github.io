<p>Backflow is a possible issue in a water supply due to the fact that it can spread infected water back through a circulation system. For instance, backflow at unchecked cross connections (cross-connections are any real or potential connection between the general public water system and a source of contamination or contamination) can enable pollutants or pollutants to go into the drinkable water system. Illness can result from consuming water that has been infected due to backflow.</p>
<p>The next criteria to assess is how the backflow prevention assembly is installed. It is necessary that the repair technician knows the correct installation orientation and can examine the installation conditions to guarantee there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly need to be set up in the installation orientation for which it was approved. Most backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, however it is important that the assembly just be set up if it is authorized for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation might cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work effectively and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work since the installation orientation is causing the failure.</p>

It's important to understand that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much higher pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Changes in line pressure, upstream or downstream, will prompt an effectively functioning RPZ assembly to periodically discharge percentages of water. Throughout a backflow condition, a big volume of water will stream from the relief valve. For this factor, RPZ assemblies should not be set up in areas subject to water damage. Sufficient drainage should also be provided.</p>

It is NOT the same thing as a Double Check although it may be marketed as one! Do not get swindled! Pressure loss through a check valve tends to be about 3 PSI. Dual Checks have losses similar to Check (5 PSI).</p>

<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Backflow is bad news. The extreme water conditions in Orlando and Central Florida are difficult on pipes. Over an amount of time the within lining of the pipe will deteriorate and a little pinhole leak will develop. Sometimes the solution is to repair the broken area of pipe, and an area repair is all that is necessary to fix the problem. Other times a more extensive solution is needed: repiping.</p>
<p>Set out the new disposal and parts in preparation for installation. I've been to lots of carwashes that have a softener, and to the surprise of the owners, the water tests hard even after having actually gone through the softener. Normally, this is due to the fact that the system is outdated or not working properly. Whatever the reason, you can be missing out on the benefits of soft water without even understanding it.</p>

A licensed professional can assist you figure out if your structure requires a backflow preventer or numerous devices, or if you receive an exemption. Exemptions, which are granted in exceptionally uncommon cases where the building is considered to not position a danger to the water system, must be submitted with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the property owner.

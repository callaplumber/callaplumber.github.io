Chicago Gas Lines specializes in natural gas installation and repair for fireplaces, fire pits, grills, devices, heaters, generators & gas lights.

<p>Remodeling plumbers usually charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one man and a truck. Once again, this does not include the cost of parts. But more and more plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their quotes are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily spend far more. With this method, you understand the turnkey price entering into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's responsibility, not yours.</p>

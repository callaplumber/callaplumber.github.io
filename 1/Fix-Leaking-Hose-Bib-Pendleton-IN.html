<p>Viking SupplyNet's extensive stock of backflow valves and related gadgets includes leading items from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the public water system react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and become breakable. This results in micro-fractures and lowers the basic structural stability of the system. The system ends up being weak and may fail without warning, causing damage to the building structure and personal property. Inappropriate installation is also a common reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be almost impossible to spot.</p>

Costing less than a full repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can accumulate in cost extremely quickly.

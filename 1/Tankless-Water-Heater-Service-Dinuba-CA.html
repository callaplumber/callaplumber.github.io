If you are using copper pipes, solder on any nipples and fittings prior to connecting the system to the bypass valve to prevent melting the plastic. Seal all threads with plumber's tape. Plastic tubing like PEX can also be utilized. Though it might need extra adapters, versatile tubing is far much easier to work with and can use push-to-connect fittings, conserving you time and the trouble of soldering.</p>
<p>Rusting and deterioration on the outside of the hot water heater, inlet pipes, or parts can suggest a prospective problem with the water heater.

<p>When the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the inbound safe and clean water supply, backpressure backflow in a structure results. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature boosts in boilers, or if there is a decline in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when unfavorable or decreased pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, generally due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building.

<p>Low pH also increases the corrosiveness of water. pH is the step of hydrogen ion activity in a service and is used to reveal the strength of the acidity of a solution. Solutions with a low pH (< 7) are acids; solutions with a high pH (> 7) are bases. Acids are substances that release hydrogen ions, which oxidize the metals in pipes, speeding up corrosion Carbon dioxide will potentially add to the development of carbonic acid, thus making the water more destructive. The existence of high levels of carbon dioxide tends to correlate with specific geologic conditions.</p>

Generally, they start little and go unnoticed, and after time can lead to large puddles below your sink and cabinets. This type results in possible water damage. Most other types of leaky kitchen sinks which are frustrating but are usually repaired quickly.

<p>When a natural gas line is ruptured, it right away ends up being a serious safety risk. Without being repaired as rapidly as possible, it might cause a fair bit of damage if the gas inside becomes ignited.

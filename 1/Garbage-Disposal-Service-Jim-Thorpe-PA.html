<p>The purpose of the Plumbing Inspection Program is to make sure that all plumbing installed throughout building of a new or remodelled structure is set up by experienced craftsmen in accordance with relevant codes. Wastewater is Flooding Your Sink - A flooding sink is the stock-image for clogged drains. When your sink is filling with water after you clean your hands, clean the dishes, or pour flat soda in your sink, you usually know your drain is clogged and needs cleaning. However, when a clogged drain emerges through flooding, the clog is probably in the draining pipes component itself. Blockages in a fixture can trigger detrimental damage to your draining system the longer they continue.</p>
<p>Tough water can leave your hair looking dull and dry and your skin feeling scratchy and flakey, and that's just what it does to your body.

<p>Light Blue = Minimized Pressure Zone - supply pressure presses open the # 1 check and is lowered by the # 1 Inspect spring (for example, to 90 psi).

If pressure in the Zone increases toward the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, avoiding backflow (reverse motion of fluid).</p>

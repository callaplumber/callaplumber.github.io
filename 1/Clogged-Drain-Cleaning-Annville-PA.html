<p>Don't put whatever down your garbage disposal. It's important to watch what you put down your waste disposal unit.

In addition, grease and oil can harden and collect in your drain as well. After completing cooking, think about putting leftover grease or oil into a container or bowl to reserve. You can then reheat and utilize for other cooking or quickly place in the garbage after it's solidified.</p>

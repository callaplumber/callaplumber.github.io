<p>In this scenario, dirty water from the hillside pool will back- siphon or back-flow down the hosepipe and into the clean water tank. You also need to buy a backflow valve if you discover your water has an uncommon circulation, taste, smell or color. A plumbing professional can figure out whether the issue with your faucet is a fast fix or the outcome of other issues in your home's plumbing system. More complicated issues with water temperature or pressure may require replacing the water heater, which generally costs $350-$ 3,500, depending on capacity and type.</p>

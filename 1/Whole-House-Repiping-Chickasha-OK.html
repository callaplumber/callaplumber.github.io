<p>A. Using phosphoric acid typically will help remove them if you have rust spots. , if you would like to attempt the gentlest method perhaps attempt using some Coke on the rust initially.. No, we aren't kidding, Coca-Cola consists of a trace amount of phosphoric acid. To attempt this, drain the toilet bowl to below where the rust marks are. Then soak some Coke. Clean with a soft cloth and after that more Coke, over and over, etc. If that does not do the trick then utilize Naval Jelly which includes a lot more phosphoric acid (be sure to check out the instructions and safety cautions initially!).

<p>Light Blue = Minimized Pressure Zone - supply pressure pushes open the # 1 check and is reduced by the # 1 Inspect spring (for instance, to 90 psi). This pressure difference across the # 1 check valve maintains the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone rises towards the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, preventing backflow (reverse motion of fluid).</p>

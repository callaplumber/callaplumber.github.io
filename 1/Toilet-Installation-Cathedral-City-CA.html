<p>Some producers claim that the electrical devices they produce can impact the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surfaces. Because these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like standard water softeners do, one advantage declared for the user is the elimination of the need to include salt to the system. While particle size decrease and plant growth promotion have actually been claimed, such systems do not eliminate minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can just alter the downstream impacts that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of specific systems has shown a reduction of calcium scale formation. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>

<p>When it comes to repiping and changing plumbing in your house, this is one of the first and main questions that you need to ask yourself. The age of your house is a critical component to understand whether you should repipe your house.

If your home was constructed before the 1970s, we strongly advise that you employ a plumbing professional to inspect your house's plumbing and check if there are locations that need repiping. If your house was constructed years before that, opportunities are that your home might need extensive repiping so that your home's plumbing can function at optimum rates.</p>

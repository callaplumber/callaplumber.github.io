<p>In this circumstance, dirty water from the hillside swimming pool will back- siphon or back-flow down the hosepipe and into the clean water tank. You also need to purchase a backflow valve if you notice your water has an uncommon circulation, color, odor or taste. A plumbing professional can identify whether the issue with your faucet is a fast fix or the result of other concerns in your house's plumbing system. More complex concerns with water temperature or pressure might require changing the hot water heater, which generally costs $350-$ 3,500, depending on capacity and type.</p>
<p>Check Valves and Double Checks. There are 2 other kinds of backflow preventers readily available that you might face. The very first is a check valve. The second is a dual check". It is NOT the same thing as a Double Check although it may be marketed as one! Do not get swindled! Pressure loss through a check valve tends to be about 3 PSI. Double Checks have losses comparable to Double Checks (5 PSI).</p>

<h3>Plumbers And House Plumbing North Easton MA</h3>
<p>Another common argument against the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't reverse through them, so the valves should avoid backflow.  The obvious problem with this is that if the backflow occurs at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A standard manually operated valve should stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if totally closed, has excellent seals, and does not leak.  However most of the automated valves, such as the electrical solenoid valves utilized for irrigation systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and fully closed.</p>

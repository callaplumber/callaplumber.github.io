<p>A minimized pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is set up in high danger" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has two spring checks, but also has a third check valve that is in fact a vent open to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is utilized in high-risk circumstances is due to the fact that if the very first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve offers an extra layer of defense compared to the DC, which will allow backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the factor that when you check an RPZ, you require water to backflow to make certain the RPZ discharges.</p>

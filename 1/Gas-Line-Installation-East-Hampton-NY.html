<p>When pressure in a water system goes beyond the pressure in the safe and clean system offering the make-up water, backpressure is developed.

Prospective impurities can then enter the safe and clean water supply. The best way to decrease build-up is have a professional flush it at least when a year.

<h3>Plumbing Drainage & Heating East Hampton NY</h3>
<p>Another common argument versus the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't reverse through them, so the valves need to prevent backflow.  The apparent issue with this is that if the backflow occurs at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A basic by hand operated valve should stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if totally closed, has great seals, and does not leak.  However the majority of the automated valves, such as the electric solenoid valves utilized for irrigation systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and totally closed.</p>
<p>Was your home developed before the 1970s and has not gone through remodeling or pipe replacement?

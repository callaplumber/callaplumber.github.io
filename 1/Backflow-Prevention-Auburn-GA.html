<p>However, there is one Do It Yourself project that isn't basic and is best left to the professionals: sewer line repair Sewer repairs can rapidly end up being complex when handled by someone with little to no experience in plumbing.

<p>Often, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as basic as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he produces information on the workings of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's duty to understand what the field test data means for that particular assembly.  When a qualified tester translates the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>

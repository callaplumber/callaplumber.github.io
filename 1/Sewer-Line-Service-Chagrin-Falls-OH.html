<p>With tankless electrical heaters, water is heated up straight whenever it's needed. Tankless systems specifically make use of an aspect that heats up water when the tap is turned on. The water is continually heated as long as the tap remains on. The water stops being heated if the tap is right away switched off.

<p>Deluge systems are developed so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems normally are set up in areas where the possibility of a severe fire condition is likely, such as aircraft hangars.

<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable water system pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable water system pressure, or a combination of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in safe and clean water system pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being utilized surpasses the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
<p>Organic particles, such as grease, food, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the cause of clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's cable television, drain or snake auger. The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can attempt to do this yourself, however this isn't a novice's DIY project. If you use the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leakages - so it's worth it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>

Water conditioners are gadgets that help avoid the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They utilize a physical media to inhibit the scale from developing by reducing the effects of the hardness itself.

Water conditioners do not successfully remove hardness from the water supply, however, as the only way to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>

<p>Chelation: Another approach is to introduce a chemical compound that acts as a chelating representative. Magnesium and calcium bind to this chelating agent and remain suspended in the water rather than building up on surface areas. However, if they stay in one place for long, as they may in a hot water heater, the buildup could still occur.</p>

The homeowner is responsible for the area from the curb to the back of their home line. Easements (generally 10 feet large) where main drains pass through personal property are an exception to this guideline.</p>

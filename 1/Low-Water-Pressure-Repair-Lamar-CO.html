Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly invest far more. With this method, you know the turnkey cost entering into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's obligation, not yours.</p>

If your toilet clogs more than when each week, it's time for a brand-new one.</p>

<p>A total repipe of a home's water supply, typically done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most detailed and pricey plumbing job, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company specializing in whole home repiping. For an outdoor gas light or home appliance whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can cause a blockage or can cause deterioration that blocks the line. Just 4" of water pressure can be enough to obstruct a natural gas line. Noise-- In time sediment can build up in the bottom of your tank. This sediment eventually gets hard and removes from the capacity of your hot water heater. This hardened sediment is likely the source of the sound.</p>

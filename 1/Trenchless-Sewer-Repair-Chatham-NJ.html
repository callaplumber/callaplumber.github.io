<p>It can take numerous weeks for backflow preventer installation and compliance to be finished. First, prepare for each device to be installed need to be drawn up by a RA or PE, and an application for approval sent to the DEP, which might take up to three weeks or more to authorize and process.

<p>A. Usually wax does not "spoil" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Also, ensure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" undiscovered issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>

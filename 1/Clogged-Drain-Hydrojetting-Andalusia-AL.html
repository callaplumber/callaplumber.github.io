<p>Backpressure is developed when pressure in a water system surpasses the pressure in the safe and clean system providing the makeup water. This can force the safe and clean water to reverse its direction of flow through the cross-connection in between the two systems. Potential contaminants can then enter the drinkable water system. The best method to lower accumulation is have a professional flush it a minimum of once a year. In some areas of Virginia, where the water is specifically difficult with high mineral content, you might need to flush the hot water heater regularly.</p>

The factors for this can range from leakages, malfunctioning or faulty electrical circuitry, or a broken heating element or thermostat. A repair or replacement of the elements may be enough if it is one of the mentioned concerns. Nevertheless, if the water heater system has all of these problems occurring frequently, then a water heater replacement is necessary.</p>

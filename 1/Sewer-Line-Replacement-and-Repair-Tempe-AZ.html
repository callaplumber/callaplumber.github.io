<h3>When Hiring A Plumber, Always Confirm The Price And Warranty Tempe AZ</h3>
<p>Another typical argument versus the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't reverse through them, so the valves ought to avoid backflow.  The apparent problem with this is that if the backflow takes place at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A basic manually run valve ought to stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if totally closed, has great seals, and does not leak.  Nevertheless the majority of the automated valves, such as the electric solenoid valves used for irrigation systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and completely closed.</p>

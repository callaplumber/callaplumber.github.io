<p>Organic particles, such as grease, food, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the cause of clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's cable, drain or snake auger. The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup.

<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. They changed my kitchen faucet and added 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always dripped in the past if I turned off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was quite reasonable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing needs. I was super delighted with their service.</p>

<p>It becomes a long-lasting fixture in the home as soon as you have a garbage disposal properly set up. You 'd be hard-pressed to find a house owner grumble about the truth that they have a garbage disposal, and lots of do not know what to do if they move into a home that does not have one.

<p>In some cases, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as easy as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he creates data on the functions of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's responsibility to understand what the field test data suggests for that specific assembly.  When a trained tester translates the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>

Pumps can develop boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in safe and clean water supply pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being utilized surpasses the amount of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>

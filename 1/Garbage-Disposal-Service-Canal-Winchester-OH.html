<p>All piping under sinks and faucets are checked for leakages or damage. How to inform if you have polybutylene pipes: If your pipes are white plastic and include the letters PB" in the printed label, you have polybutylene pipes and we suggest having them replaced right now. Before you can request an inspection, you need to first obtain the needed permit( s) for the work you plan to do. You can have a look at our Authorization page for additional information on acquiring an authorization. Once you acquire a permit you can commence with the work. However, you need to call for inspection before you conceal any work or cover.</p>

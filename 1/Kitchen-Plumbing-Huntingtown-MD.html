<p>Depending upon what part of the world you're from you may have heard sink disposals described as garbage disposals," food waste disposers," or, if you're truly correct, a sink waste disposal system." Whatever you call it, changing one out or installing a brand-new one is a fairly easy job.

<p>Organic debris, such as hair, food, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the cause of clogged drains.

You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a beginner's Do It Yourself job. If you utilize the tool incorrectly, you can harm your pipes and cause other leakages - so it deserves it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>

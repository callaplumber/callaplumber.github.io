<p>Gradually, like any other home appliance in your house, your waste disposal unit. may require repairs. A disposal system may clog or begin to leak through heavy, or improper, use.

<p>A partial reroute is essentially a small scale repiping of one or more affected locations of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost reliable, it is possible to just desert the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, attics and walls. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can build up in cost extremely rapidly. This is the main reason we will advise a full repipe in particular neighborhoods, based on our experience.</p>

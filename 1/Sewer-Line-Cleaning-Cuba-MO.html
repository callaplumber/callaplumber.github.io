<p>One common way for a house's supply of water to be contaminated is if the watering water lines, which could end up being tainted by pesticides or weed poison, backflow into the interior water lines. If that polluted water were to backflow into the neighborhood drinking supply, the issue could spread significantly. A backflow preventer not just protects drinking water in specific houses, it likewise avoids wastewater in private houses from flowing back out and infecting the public supply of water.</p>
<p>When the pressure in a private water system goes beyond the pressure in the public water distribution lines that can cause regular flow to reverse, backpressure occurs. A pump used to increase the water pressure within a structure's plumbing system to reach a greater floor may cause this. Preventive cleaning for drains should be performed on all drains, including toilet, tub, floor and sink drains.</p>

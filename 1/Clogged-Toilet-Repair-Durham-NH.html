<h3>Things To Consider Before Hiring A Plumber Durham NH</h3>
<p>The use of dissimilar metals in the plumbing can result in galvanic deterioration Direct contact between different metals will start the development of a galvanic cell, which is produced whenever 2 various types of metal are conductively connected to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be worn away and an electrical current is developed since of the process. A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe. It is likewise worth keeping in mind that while using a brass fitting to bridge the gap in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not entirely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to alleviate this direct contact between the different metals. A dielectric coupling consists of an insulating material that physically separates contact between the two metals.</p>

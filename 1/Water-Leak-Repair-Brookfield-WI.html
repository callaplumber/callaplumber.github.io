By the method, this is a fantastic system. Our energy costs are much lower then previously, the air flow is almost undetectable, the air temperature within is even, the humidity contstant, and we have actually had no failures given that installation.</p>
<p>Chelation: Another approach is to introduce a chemical substance that acts as a chelating agent.

However, if they stay in one place for long, as they might in a hot water heater, the buildup might still occur.</p>

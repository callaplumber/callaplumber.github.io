<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the normal solution is to have the malfunctioning pipes replaced. Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping comes in. This is an option to consider if you live in an older house - such as one constructed pre-1970 - or any house with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular option for home plumbing for many years, however steel eventually suffers from corrosion and lacks the resilience these days's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>

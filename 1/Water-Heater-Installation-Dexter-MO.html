Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature boosts in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when negative or reduced pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, typically due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity.

A common kind of backflow preventer is the minimized pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>

<p>A lowered pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is set up in high risk" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has 2 spring checks, however also has a 3rd check valve that is in fact a vent open to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is used in high-risk situations is since if the first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens.

<p>A. The toilet fill valve measurements we reveal are determined from the within bottom of the tank to the top of the fill valve. The threaded supply of water shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not consisted of in this measurement.

A PE or RA can help determine if installing a pump or bigger size water service and backflow prevention device would combat the pressure loss.</p>

<p>When the hardware parts have been cleaned and checked and the rubber parts have been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their parts. Some parts may have extremely tight tolerances that need to be kept. A crucial thing to identify on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the component. The guide is an extremely important part of the design of each part. If the element is not fixed effectively, the guide could limit the movement (rather than direct or consistent) of the component, which might cause the component to not work to its abilities. Sometimes springs are erroneously blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. Most of the times the guides are restricting the travel of the element causing lower test results than what is needed.</p>

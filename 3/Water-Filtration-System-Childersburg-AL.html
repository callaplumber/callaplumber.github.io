<p>Test for water tightness by plugging the drain with the stopper and filling the sink with an inch of water.

Check for leaks and tighten as necessary. Plug unit into a GFCI-protected receptacle, and organize cables as desired.</p>
<p>The most typical technique for producing soft water is through ion exchange, a procedure in which the calcium and magnesium in the water are exchanged for another aspect, normally sodium. Sodium will not cause lime scale or soap residue accumulation like other minerals do, and water softening includes only a really small amount of salt to your water.

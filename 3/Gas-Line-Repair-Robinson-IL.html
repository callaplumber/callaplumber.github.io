The installers begin by placing a "bursting head" at the gain access to point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is utilized to drag the head through the pipe. As it makes its method through the system, breaking the old pipe apart and attracting a new seamless pipe behind it. The pipe is a plastic material that will be invulnerable to root invasion for approximately 100 years.</p>

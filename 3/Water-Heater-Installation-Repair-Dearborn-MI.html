Increased defense is also required when chemicals are contributed to a fire security system supplied by a potable water supply. Remind them to avoid hanging on any visible pipelines or playing with the outdoor gas meter if you have kids. Holding on a pipeline might trigger it to come loose or break, launching gas into the home. The outdoor gas meter must be kept clear of any particles, such as plants or snow, so it is easily accessible in an emergency.</p>

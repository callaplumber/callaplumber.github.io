<p>A total repipe of a home's water supply, frequently done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most intricate and costly plumbing task, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company focusing on whole home repiping. Current Review: Carlos and Lopez were amazing. My 90 year old Dad's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos reached 8am the next day to repair. Since of the age of the house and area of the pipe, it was a difficult job. They worked for nearly 12 hours into darkness to ensure the system was working before they left. I am truly grateful for their hard work and professionalism.</p>

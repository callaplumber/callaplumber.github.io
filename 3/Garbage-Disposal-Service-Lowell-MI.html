Applications vary from softening in remote locations to resolving issues of reagent addition. Motor sizes for waste disposal unit are given up horse power, or HP. These correspond directly to how much waste the unit can deal with, and suggested sizes are typically based upon how many users are in a household. If your existing disposal clogs frequently, is loud, leakages or does not run correctly, it may be time for a replacement. Installations ought to only be performed by plumbers as the installation requires both plumbing and electrical connections.</p>
<p>The individual who does the testing must be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this accreditation, and a plumbing license is not required to acquire this accreditation.

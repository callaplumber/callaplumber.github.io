It is very important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the disadvantage shut down remains in the closed position. This enables the parts to move to their pressurized positions in an accurate motion. As soon as the assembly is pressurized, then any accumulated air must be removed from the body. Many backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be gotten rid of from crucial areas in the assembly.

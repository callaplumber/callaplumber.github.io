<p>The trick to preventing a clogged waste disposal unit is small amounts. As long as the food waste is sent through the disposal at a reasonable amount, there should be no concern in getting most of the waste through. There are a few food products you must most likely not take into the waste disposal unit though. Those products are coffee premises, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another idea to stop blocking is to watch out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will harden when they cool so it is best to wash pots and pans that have those liquids under warm water and to continue to let the water run for a number of seconds after you are completed cleaning to make sure the drain is clear.</p>

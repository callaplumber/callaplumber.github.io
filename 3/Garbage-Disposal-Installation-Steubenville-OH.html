<p>Sooner or later, however, the beads reach maximum capability and can't draw in any more mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank must be regrowed, or, flushed clean. That's where the salt water tank is available in. An on-board computer computes the amount of water that flows through the softener. Regeneration immediately starts when it reaches the preprogrammed setting. For a three-bedroom home and household of 4, regeneration generally happens every 12,000 gallons.</p>
<p>Nearly all softeners fall into one of 2 classifications. Timed designs have programmable timeclocks that will restore on an established schedule and after that go back to service. These work well for families that are on routine water-using cycles but will waste more water and salt due to the fact that they regrow whether the resin requires it or not. Demand-control models, with either electrical and mechanical sensing units, normally restore after so many gallons of water have actually been softened. If you have a changing water use schedule, such designs are hassle-free.</p>

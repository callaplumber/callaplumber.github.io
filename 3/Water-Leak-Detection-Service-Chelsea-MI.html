<h3>Clogged Tub Drain in Chelsea Michigan</h2>
<p>A partial reroute is generally a small scale repiping of one or more afflicted locations of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost effective, it is possible to just abandon the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, walls and attics. Costing less than a full repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can add up in cost extremely rapidly. This is the main reason why we will recommend a complete repipe in specific areas, based on our experience.</p>
<p>Tank to Tank installation: On average, replacing a gas or electric water tank with a similar model takes two to three hours. It takes in between 45 to 60 minutes to drain, disconnect and eliminate your old water heater. Placing the brand-new unit takes approximately 30 minutes, and it takes another 45 to 60 minutes to secure the new connection points and verify that all functions are up to code.</p>
<p>Wet pipe systems are set up in locations where the ambient temperature level is preserved at or above 40 ° F. When a sprinkler is triggered by heat from a fire, water flows instantly from the sprinkler head. These systems have water in the pipe at all times. In circumstances where there is a need to provide sprinklers in an unheated area, such as a small packing dock, an antifreeze system can be used. The addition of this chemical additive will require the installation of a high hazard security assembly.</p>

Prior to repiping can occur, nevertheless, you need to be able to find the signs that this is even required.

<p>The typical solution is to have the defective pipes replaced when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping comes in. This is an option to think about if you live in an older house - such as one developed pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular choice for house plumbing for numerous years, but steel ultimately struggles with deterioration and does not have the sturdiness of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>

<p>A partial reroute is generally a small scale repiping of one or more afflicted areas of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost efficient, it is possible to just desert the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, attics and walls. Costing less than a complete repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can add up in cost really quickly. This is the main reason we will advise a complete repipe in certain neighborhoods, based upon our experience.</p>

<h3>Professional Experience Is Essential For A Good Plumber Santa Cruz CA</h3>
<p>Backflow preventer installation requires the services of a licensed professional engineer (PE) or licensed registered architect (RA), and licensed master plumber (LMP). A licensed professional can help you figure out if your structure needs a backflow preventer or multiple gadgets, or if you get approved for an exemption. Exemptions, which are given in incredibly rare cases where the structure is considered to not posture a risk to the water system, should be submitted with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the homeowner. If your structure has an existing backflow preventer, however the DEP has no record of its installation, you should have a licensed professional file a record drawing of the device, in addition to an initial test report of the device for DEP evaluation.</p>

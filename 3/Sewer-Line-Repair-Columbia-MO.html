The reasons for this can vary from leaks, malfunctioning or malfunctioning electrical wiring, or a broken heating aspect or thermostat.

<p>A normal whole-house repipe can take anywhere from 3 to five days, depending upon the size of the home, the number of levels it has actually and the chosen pipe material. During a repipe, plumbers will make strategic cuts in the drywall, completely replace the pipes, re-install the eliminated drywall and spot it to remove any signs of damage or modification to your house.</p>

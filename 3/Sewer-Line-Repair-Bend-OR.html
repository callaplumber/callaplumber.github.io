<p>A partial reroute is essentially a little scale repiping of several afflicted locations of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost effective, it is possible to just desert the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, attics and walls. Costing less than a full repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can add up in cost really quickly. This is the main reason that we will suggest a full repipe in particular communities, based on our experience.</p>

Lastly, a quality contractor will not risk working with an inferior plumber. An easy mistake-- a joint left unsoldered or a leaky PVC line-- can quickly devastate $10,000 worth of walls or wood floors and make complex the job with insurance coverage claims, lost time, and claims. With a lot riding on the plumber, contractors tend to stick with only the very best.</p>

<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water supply pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can produce boosts in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in drinkable water supply pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being used exceeds the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water pipe.</p>

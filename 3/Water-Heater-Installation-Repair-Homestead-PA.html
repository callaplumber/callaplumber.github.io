Once it has actually passed through the valve, a backflow prevention assembly is a mechanical valve plan developed to avoid the reversal of the circulation of water. The two types of pipes that we choose to use for repiping are copper and PEX. These are 2 extremely different products, but they both have extraordinary toughness and longevity.</p>

Residences built in the very first part of the 1900s were plumbed using lead pipes. At that time, individuals had no idea that the lead in the pipes could leach into the drinking water, not to mention the health threats related to lead.</p>
<p>One common way for a house's water supply to be contaminated is if the watering water lines, which could become tainted by pesticides or weed toxin, backflow into the interior water lines. If that contaminated water were to backflow into the neighborhood drinking supply, the issue might spread out exponentially. A backflow preventer not only protects drinking water in specific houses, it also prevents wastewater in personal houses from flowing back out and polluting the public water system.</p>
<p>In some families, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to technique when looking for a practical solution, specifically when basic plunging does not seem to work. Nevertheless, there are numerous disadvantages to using these dangerous items - not least of which is that they generally contain compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is triggering a clog, which can vary from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, little objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, but at the cost of presenting the risk of damage to your house and family.</p>

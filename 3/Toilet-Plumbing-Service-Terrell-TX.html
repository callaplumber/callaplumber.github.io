<p>A. Generally wax does not "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Likewise, make certain the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" unnoticed issue. Attempt putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>Set up 50 gallon electrical water heater and thermal growth tank. When your drains are clogged, you will most likely start to see gurgling noises, water backing up into your sink or shower, or strange smells. Drain obstructions are caused by wear and tear or a build-up of things we put down the drain gradually and as we know, they can cause severe plumbing problems.</p>

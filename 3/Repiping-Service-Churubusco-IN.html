<p>In some families, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to technique when searching for a practical option, especially when easy plunging doesn't appear to work. Nevertheless, there are lots of drawbacks to utilizing these dangerous products - not least of which is that they generally consist of substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is causing an obstruction, which can vary from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, small things, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life.

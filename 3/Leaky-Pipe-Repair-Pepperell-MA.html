<p>Loose flanges are generally the result of wood rot. The flange screws merely won't hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best solution depends upon the level of the rot.

Prior to you install this sort of ring, hold it approximately the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might need to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet.

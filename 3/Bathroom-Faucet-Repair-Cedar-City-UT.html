<p>Plainly the resin is not an endless exchange website. When all the salt exchange websites are replaced with solidity minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be run on an alternate cycle called regrowth. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt solution. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to utilize as soon as backwashing is complete. Some water softeners will immediately switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch.

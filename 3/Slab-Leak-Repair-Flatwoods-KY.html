For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will rust a lot more quickly. Consistent gross smells coming from the toilet can suggest you need a new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting effectively, you might need a new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can trigger a leak and burst.

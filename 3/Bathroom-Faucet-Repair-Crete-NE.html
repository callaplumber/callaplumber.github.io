<p>When drains are clogged, it is not constantly due to clogs that stem inside the house. It is possible for drains to end up being clogged due to tree roots, also called tree root invasion. When tree roots start to make their way inside someone's main sewer line, there is potential for this to trigger drain problems. The kind of drain pipes already set up, such as cast iron, copper, plastic or clay, will figure out the extent of the damage that tree roots can cause to a sewer line.</p>
<p>When a flush valve causes a toilet to run, a used flapper is usually the culprit. But not always. Initially, look at the chain that raises the flapper. It can tangle up and prevent the flapper from closing securely if there's too much slack in the chain. A chain with too little slack can trigger difficulty too. Image 3 shows how to set the slack perfect.</p>

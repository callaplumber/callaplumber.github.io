Some fill toilet valves have a float adjustment screw on top (see Figure A below). Flex the float arm if there is no modification screw. Make sure it's adjusted appropriately (Photo 8)if you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve. You don't have to clear the tank to make these modifications.</p>
<p>In some households, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to method when looking for a viable service, specifically when simple plunging doesn't appear to work. However, there are many disadvantages to using these hazardous products - not least of which is that they generally include compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is triggering a blockage, which can vary from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, little things, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, but at the cost of providing the danger of harm to your house and family.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the majority of the time, it's safe to state that any repairs that need to be completed will come out of the pocketbook of a property owner. Plumbing Codes and State law dictate minimum standards for backflow prevention.

<p>If your flapper valve has a ball that floats at the end of a rod, carefully listen and raise the rod. If the water shuts down, you may have the ability to stop the running by adjusting the float. Some fill toilet valves have a float change screw on top (see Figure A below). Bend the float arm if there is no adjustment screw. Make sure it's adjusted effectively (Picture 8)if you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve. You do not need to empty the tank to make these adjustments.</p>
<p>Backflow preventers not adhering to these guidelines for an offered application and which are worn out or broken and need replacement must be replaced by a backflow preventer which does comply to the guidelines for the offered application.

Fluctuations in line pressure, upstream or downstream, will prompt a properly working RPZ assembly to regularly release small amounts of water. During a backflow condition, a large volume of water will flow from the relief valve. For this reason, RPZ assemblies should not be installed in locations based on water damage. Appropriate drainage needs to also be provided.</p>

Galvanized pipes were frequently installed in houses of this age, and these kinds of pipes are known to wear away and burst when they get old.

This usually adds anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the overall cost of the waste disposal unit installation.</p>
<p>Your garbage disposal guarantees that your sink and plumbing fixtures don't get clogged. Contrary to some people's perception, waste disposal unit do not include blades. Rather, a garbage disposal features 2 fixed bolts that are fixed to a spinning disk.

This high-speed action successfully pulverizes the food waste in the disposal so that it can travel down the drain without obstructing.</p>

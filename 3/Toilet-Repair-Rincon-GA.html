Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can produce boosts in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in safe and clean water system pressure take place whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the amount of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>

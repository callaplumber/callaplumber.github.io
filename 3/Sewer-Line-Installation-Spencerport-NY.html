<p>Note: Tough water stops your washing cleaning agent from working effectively because hard water ions can bond with detergent molecules to deactivate them. You, for that reason, have to utilize increasingly more cleaning agent to achieve the same cleaning power. The media gets a bath in the salt service. Hard minerals captured in the resin (or zeolite) are released and the media gets renewed with sodium ions. The water softener is likewise cleaned up and decontaminated throughout regeneration. Lastly, water containing the hard minerals and other waste gets eliminated of the system.</p>

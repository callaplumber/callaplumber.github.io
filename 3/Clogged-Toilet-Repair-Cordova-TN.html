Obviously it begins with pin hole leakages in the copper piping and can cause major damage if the leak isn't spotted soon.</p>
<p>Your house's drainage works by the basic force of gravity. When you flush water and squander down your sink or shower (and your toilets also) it's not truly the circulation of water pushing them down your pipes. Rather, once they decrease your drain, gravity takes control of as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a down angle to the sewer line. When something obstructs the pipes, anything you put down there will not go through.</p>

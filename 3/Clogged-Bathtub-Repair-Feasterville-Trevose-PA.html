<p>Before the repair professional begins the repair procedure, he must be sure he has actually assessed the workspace around the backflow prevention assembly in order to determine any limiting conditions.

A safe and proper work environment may require the positioning of safety barricades or entry constraints around the workspace so the repair professional or the public around your work area are not damaged.

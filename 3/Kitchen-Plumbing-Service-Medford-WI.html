<p>Sewer linings can help to repair split pipes without needing to totally replace your sewer lines or damage the area around them. Everyday use should not cause a water softener to leak. Leaks can also occur if you run into the softener and jostle it, pulling the fitting apart. To avoid this from occurring, install the unit in a safe and steady  location. If you live in an earthquake-prone area of the nation, protect the softener so that if the structure begins moving, the softener doesn't tip over and remove the plumbing. If your water softener is leaking throughout regrowth, you need to wait up until after the cycle is finished and then inspected the system for cracks or broken fittings. You should also check to make certain your drain line is never ever blocked up with debris. A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener during regrowth and flood your basement or garage.</p>

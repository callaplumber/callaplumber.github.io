Increases in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in potable supply of water pressure occur whenever the amount of water being utilized exceeds the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>

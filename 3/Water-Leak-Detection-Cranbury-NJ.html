<h3>Tips For Finding An Emergency Plumber Cranbury NJ</h3>
<p>To figure out if your home is a poly house," begin with the outside. Underground water mains are generally blue in color (they can also be gray or black). The pipe is generally 1/2 to 1-inch in diameter. Frequently, it enters the house near the water heater. Your main shut off is attached to the end of the water main. Ensure you check both ends of the pipe. We have found cases where the copper pipe enters the house and polybutylene is at the meter.</p>
<p>3. Think about a hair-stopper: The number 1 reason our Thousand Oaks drain cleaning specialists are called into a house is due to the fact that there is excessive hair in the shower drain. Hair-stoppers are easy and quite inexpensive to install, so there's no factor not to. When grease strengthens it adheres to the pipe and avoids water flow, eventually causing a backup. This added with other debris in your drain can trigger a major backup.</p>

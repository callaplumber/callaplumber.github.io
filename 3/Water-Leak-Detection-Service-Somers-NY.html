<p>How to install or replace a garbage disposal. Sewer lines can stop working for a variety of reasons, consisting of poor soil conditions, blockages from grease and grime, and deterioration. Even bushes and trees can trigger problems for sewer lines, specifically in older communities where clay pipe might have been used.

<p>With PVC you have a number of choices if your pipe is failing; one is to repair the bad connection that is causing an interruption. The other is to go ahead and replace the entire line. Certainly replace if the line is about 40 years old and is showing indications of age throughout. Nowadays, you can replace the pipe without a digging trench. Based upon the condition of the line, it may be an acceptable choice to do just that. However, if the offset worsens trenchless may no longer be an option.</p>

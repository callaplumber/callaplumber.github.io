<p>Whether you're a house owner, entrepreneur, or home manager, at some point you will probably need to call a plumber. It's a great concept to do a little research study into the world of plumbing prior to you call somebody and turn them loose on your plumbing system. A good plumber can conserve your bacon. A bad plumber can be your worst problem in terms of issues that keep coming back to bite you.</p>
<p>Improvement plumbers typically charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one man and a truck. Once again, this doesn't include the cost of parts. But increasingly more plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their bids are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly spend far more. With this technique, you understand the turnkey cost going into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's duty, not yours.</p>

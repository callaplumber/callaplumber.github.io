<p>Viking SupplyNet's extensive stock of backflow valves and associated devices includes leading products from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public water supply react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and become fragile. This leads to micro-fractures and decreases the standard structural stability of the system. The system becomes weak and might fail without warning, causing damage to the building structure and personal property. Inappropriate installation is also a typical reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly difficult to spot.</p>

Rinckey stated that both Belding and Greenville city water steps around 18 gpg, which is considered exceptionally tough water, leaving dead giveaways like spotty glasses and soap scum that is next to difficult to get rid of.

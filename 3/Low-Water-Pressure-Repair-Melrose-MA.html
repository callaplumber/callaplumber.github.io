<h3>How To Select A Credible Plumber Melrose MA</h3>

Exemptions, which are approved in very rare cases where the building is considered to not pose a risk to the supply of water, must be filed with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the property owner. If your structure has an existing backflow preventer, but the DEP has no record of its installation, you should have a licensed professional file a record illustration of the device, as well as an initial test report of the device for DEP evaluation.</p>

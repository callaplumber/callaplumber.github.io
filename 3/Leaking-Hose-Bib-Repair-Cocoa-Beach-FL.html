<p>After professional drain cleaning, there are a couple of things you can do to keep your drains clear. Prevent putting grease or oil down the drains. Utilize a solution of baking soda and vinegar periodically to keep your drains and garbage disposal clean. You can use an organic drain cleaner month-to-month to keep your drains clear. We advise organic items, such as Bio-Clean, since they work much better than products containing severe chemicals and won't cause damage to your drains or fixtures.</p>

Which is why choosing a comfortable, well-made toilet seat is extremely crucial. Nevertheless, you need to make sure your toilet seat in fact fits your toilet. Most of toilets are standard sized - meaning a "will fit" seat is sufficient for security and convenience. Some toilets, however, have uniquely formed bowls and require a particular seat, like the Eljer Symbol. It really isn't an excellent idea to use a toilet seat that is either much too huge or much to little, unless they have actually been particularly created to fit regular toilets, as the toilet seat can wobble and trigger you to slide around, or will not disperse your weight uniformly and could ultimately trigger cracks in the bowl.</p>

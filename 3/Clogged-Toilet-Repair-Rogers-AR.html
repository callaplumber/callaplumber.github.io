<p>It is not constantly due to blockages that come from inside the home when drains are clogged. It is possible for drains to end up being clogged due to tree roots, also called tree root intrusion. When tree roots start to make their method inside somebody's main sewer line, there is capacity for this to cause drain problems. The type of drain pipes currently set up, such as cast iron, clay, plastic or copper, will identify the degree of the damage that tree roots can cause to a sewer line.</p>
<p>The pipe-bursting technique is used on pipes that are significantly damaged, for changing a whole pipe system, or for fixing larger sections of sewer pipeline The installers need physical access to the pipe in order to start repair, which includes 2 4 foot square gain access to pits at either end of the pipeline. The installers start by placing a "bursting head" at the access point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is used to drag the head through the pipe. As it makes its method through the system, breaking the old pipe apart and drawing in a brand-new smooth pipe behind it. The pipe is a plastic product that will be resistant to root invasion for approximately 100 years.</p>

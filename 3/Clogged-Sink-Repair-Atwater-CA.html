Leakages can likewise happen if you bump into the softener and scramble it, pulling the fitting apart. To prevent this from taking place, install the system in a safe and stable  place. If you live in an earthquake-prone area of the country, secure the softener so that if the structure starts moving, the softener does not fall over and rip out the plumbing. If your water softener is leaking during regeneration, you need to wait until after the cycle is completed and then inspected the system for fractures or broken fittings. You must also examine to make certain your drain line is never ever blocked up with debris. A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener during regeneration and flood your basement or garage.</p>

To prevent this, ensure the new garbage disposal installation set includes a tube, or purchase one independently at the same time for about $3.</p>

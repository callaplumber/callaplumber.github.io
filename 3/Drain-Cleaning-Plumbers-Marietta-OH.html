<p>If you have an older home, there's a good chance you have galvanized pipes. And if your home was built in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are probably nearing completion of their life-span. As galvanized pipes age, they start to wear away. This rust can result in an accumulation of lead, which can have numerous negative effects on your health. Rusty pipes also lead to poor water quality and low water pressure.</p>
<p>Your waste disposal unit makes sure that your sink and plumbing fixtures don't get clogged. Contrary to some people's understanding, garbage disposals do not include blades. Rather, a garbage disposal features two stationary bolts that are fixed to a spinning disk. When the disposal is turned on the disks quickly spin, and these bolts force food and debris to grind versus a stationary grinder along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action effectively pulverizes the food waste in the disposal so that it can take a trip down the drain without clogging.</p>

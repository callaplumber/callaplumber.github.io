<p>Is your home 50+ years of ages? Up through the mid-twentieth century, galvanized steel was the main material used in plumbing.

<p>Reverse osmosis uses an applied pressure gradient throughout a semi permeable membrane to overcome osmotic pressure and get rid of water molecules from the option with hardness ions. The membrane has pores large enough to admit water molecules for passage; solidity ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ will not fit through the pores. The resulting soft water supply is free of hardness ions with no other ions being added. Membranes are a type of water filter needing regular cleaning or replacement maintenance.</p>

<h3>Working Consistently With Your Emergency Plumber Lexington VA</h3>
<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable water supply pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can develop boosts in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in potable water system pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being utilized exceeds the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water pipe.</p>

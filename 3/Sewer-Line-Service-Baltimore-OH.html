<p>Backflow suggests the undesirable turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the drinkable supply of water; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from occurring. Points at which a potable water supply connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, however they must be thoroughly designed and set up to avoid backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>

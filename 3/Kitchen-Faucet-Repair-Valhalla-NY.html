It is essential that the repair service technician understands the appropriate installation orientation and can examine the installation conditions to ensure there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly.

Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, but it is essential that the assembly just be set up if it is authorized for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation might trigger the backflow prevention assembly to not work effectively and no matter the number of parts you put inside the assembly, it still might not work because the installation orientation is causing the failure.</p>

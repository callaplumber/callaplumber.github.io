For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will corrode much more quickly. Consistent gross smells coming from the toilet can show you need a new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. You might need a new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising effectively. Bulges in the supply line can trigger a leak and burst.

<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumber Crestwood KY</h3>
<p>These men were amazing! They appeared early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been an issue off and on for several years now. It was installed 7 years earlier, and it never ever drained this well. I picked this company due to the fact that they had fantastic reviews and a reasonable rate, and even though the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a huge, disgusting mess on their hands (actually), and they did an excellent task tidying up after it also.</p>
<p>Use of tankless systems in 2nd homes gets rid of threats of water damage.

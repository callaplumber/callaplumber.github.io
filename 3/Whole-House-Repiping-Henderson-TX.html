Which is why selecting a comfortable, reliable toilet seat is very important. Nevertheless, you need to make sure your toilet seat actually fits your toilet. Most of toilets are basic sized - implying a "will fit" seat is sufficient for security and convenience. Some toilets, however, have uniquely shaped bowls and need a particular seat, like the Eljer Symbol.

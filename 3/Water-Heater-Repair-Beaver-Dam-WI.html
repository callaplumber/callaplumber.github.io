There are a few food products you need to probably not put into the waste disposal unit though. Those items are coffee grounds, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another suggestion to stop obstructing is to watch out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will harden when they cool so it is best to wash pots and pans that have those liquids under warm water and to continue to let the water run for numerous seconds after you are ended up cleaning to make sure the drain is clear.</p>

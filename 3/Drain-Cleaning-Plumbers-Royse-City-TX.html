<p>After professional drain cleaning, there are a couple of things you can do to keep your drains clear. Avoid putting grease or oil down the drains. Utilize a solution of baking soda and vinegar occasionally to keep your drains and waste disposal unit clean. You can use an organic drain cleaner month-to-month to keep your drains clear. We advise natural products, such as Bio-Clean, since they work much better than products containing harsh chemicals and will not cause damage to your drains or fixtures.</p>
<p>If you hear water running in your toilet and you presume a leaky toilet tank or toilet bowl, try this: spray a couple of drops of food coloring to the toilet tank and let the toilet sit for about half an hour. After thirty minutes, inspect to see if any of the water in your toilet bowl has changed color. You most likely have a leak if it has.</p>

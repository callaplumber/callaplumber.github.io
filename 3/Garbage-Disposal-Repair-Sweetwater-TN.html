<p>Viking SupplyNet's comprehensive stock of backflow valves and related devices consists of leading items from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the public water system respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and become fragile. This leads to micro-fractures and lowers the standard structural stability of the system. The system ends up being weak and might stop working without warning, causing damage to the building structure and personal property. Incorrect installation is likewise a typical reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be almost impossible to detect.</p>

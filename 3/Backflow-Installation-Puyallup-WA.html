<p>Viking SupplyNet's extensive stock of backflow valves and associated devices includes leading products from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the public water supply respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, triggering them to scale, flake, and end up being breakable. This results in micro-fractures and minimizes the fundamental structural stability of the system. The system ends up being weak and might stop working without caution, triggering damage to the building structure and personal property. Incorrect installation is also a common reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be almost difficult to spot.</p>

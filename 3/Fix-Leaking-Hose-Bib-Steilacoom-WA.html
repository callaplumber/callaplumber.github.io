The closer the device is to that 8 to 12-year limit, the more skeptical the economics of a repair becomes. The reason is that some other part on the appliance will go or its tank will leak. And there's no cure for a leaking tank.</p>

<p>One common way for a house's water system to be polluted is if the watering water lines, which might end up being polluted by pesticides or weed poison, backflow into the interior water lines. The issue might spread exponentially if that infected water were to backflow into the community drinking supply. A backflow preventer not only protects drinking water in specific homes, it also avoids wastewater in private homes from flowing back out and polluting the public supply of water.</p>
<p>That is an indication the tank is stopping working and will need to be replaced if the water heater is leaking from the bottom of the tank. Schedule a quote as quickly as possible and ensure nothing is near the heater that could be possibly harmed if it is in a garage and a little slow leak. Leaking hot water heater can burst triggering water damage and flooding of homes.</p>

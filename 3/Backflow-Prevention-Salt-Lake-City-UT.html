<p>You live in an older house. There's a good possibility that you'll need to have it done soon if your home is 50 years old or older and you have actually never replaced its pipes. Galvanized pipes were frequently installed in houses of this age, and these kinds of pipes are understood to rust and burst when they get old.

<p>Kitchen sinks are constantly vulnerable to clogs with food and grease being the significant perpetrators. If fats are poured down the sink, they harden to the piping walls.

You need your drain cleaned up before it leads to further damage and even costlier repairs if this is what is taking place to your house.</p>

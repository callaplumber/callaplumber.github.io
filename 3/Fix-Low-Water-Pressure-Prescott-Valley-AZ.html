<p>A general rule is that you can regain the cost of the repair if the problems happens well outside that 8 to 12 year lifespan. If, state, you need a new burner kit and the hot water heater is five years of ages, then it makes sense for you to spend the $120 for the part, especially if you can do the work yourself.

<p>Clearly the resin is not an inexhaustible exchange site. When all the salt exchange websites are changed with firmness minerals, the resin is invested and will no longer soften water. At this moment, the water softener will need to be worked on an alternate cycle called regrowth. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt option. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. When backwashing is total, the softener can be gone back to utilize. Some water softeners will instantly change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 highlights both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>
<p>So now that you know you have a backup in your main line, how do you clear it? Sadly, main line clogs are not something a property owner can fix.

<p>Backflow Preventer: A device that permits water to go through it in one direction, however prevents it from reversing in the opposite instructions. You have long-term water firmness if you do not see limescale build-up but rather see soap residue, your washing cleaning agents not working as successfully or your skin getting scratchy and delicate. If you smell gas, do not attempt to locate the leak. Rather, leave the house or building right now.

<p>The salt water tank help the water softening system in regeneration. It is a shorter tank that sits adjacent to the mineral tank. The salt water tank holds a highly concentrated option of salt (or in some cases potassium) to bring back the resin beads' favorable charge. Salt is by hand contributed to the brine tank in the type of pellets or blocks. These dissolve in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve signs up the softening capability of the resin is lessening, the heavy salt water solution is drawn out of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank.

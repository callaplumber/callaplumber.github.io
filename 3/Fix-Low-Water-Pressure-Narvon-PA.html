Section 312.10 of the Ohio Plumbing Code covers the installation, repairs and testing of isolation backflow preventers (BFP) and Area 608 of the Ohio Plumbing Code addresses security of the drinkable water supply within a building these devices are known as isolation" BFP. Once again, the very best type of backflow prevention is an air gap, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would flow over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to guarantee there is an air space, if there is no way to supply one, then we examine to see that the proper BFP device is installed. These BFP's, if testable, are needed to be tested (by a certified backflow preventer tester) upon installation and a minimum of every twelve months thereafter.</p>

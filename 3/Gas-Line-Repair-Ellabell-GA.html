<p>After professional drain cleaning, there are a few things you can do to keep your drains clear. Avoid putting grease or oil down the drains. Use a service of baking soda and vinegar occasionally to keep your drains and waste disposal unit clean. You can utilize an organic drain cleaner monthly to keep your drains clear.

<p>The electrical and plumbing work involved in garbage disposal installation make the task possibly harmful. That makes it an excellent factor to hire a professional plumber to install or replace your disposal.

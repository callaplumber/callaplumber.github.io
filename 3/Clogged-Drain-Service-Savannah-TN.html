<p>If you have an older home, there's a good chance you have galvanized pipes. And if your house was built in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are most likely nearing completion of their lifespan. As galvanized pipes age, they start to wear away. This corrosion can lead to a buildup of lead, which can have many unfavorable results on your health. Rusty pipes also lead to poor water quality and low water pressure.</p>
<p>In the meantime, however, we suggest you very first shot utilizing non-abrasive and non-harsh white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Just pour a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, include some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mix sit for a while. You can attempt a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner if that does not work. Much of these cleaners contain concentrated levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be really damaging if it can be found in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. If using one of these items, please make sure to take the suitable preventative measures.</p>

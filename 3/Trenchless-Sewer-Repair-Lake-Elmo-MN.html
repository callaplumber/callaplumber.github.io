<p>Once the hardware parts have been cleaned and examined and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some parts might have really tight tolerances that have to be maintained. A crucial thing to determine on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the component. The guide is a really vital part of the design of each component. If the element is not fixed appropriately, the guide could restrict the movement (instead of steady or direct) of the component, which could cause the part to not work to its abilities. Sometimes springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. For the most part the guides are restricting the travel of the component causing lower test results than what is required.</p>

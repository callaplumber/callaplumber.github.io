Nevertheless, there are numerous disadvantages to using these hazardous items - not least of which is that they normally include substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is triggering a clog, which can range from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, small items, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your residential or commercial property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them reliable, but at the cost of presenting the danger of harm to your home and family.</p>

Trenchless pipe repair also known as trenchless pipe lining is a outstanding and long lasting  alternative for your damaged pipes. The pipe lining procedure includes our group saturating a felt liner with a special resin mix. It is pressed through your pipeline when the felt liner is totally saturated. As the liner moves through your pipes, it coats the interior walls, sealing all imperfections and fractures.

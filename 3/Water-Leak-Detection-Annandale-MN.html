<h3>Plumber Work Scope And Its Specialization Annandale MN</h3>
<p>The use of different metals in the plumbing can result in galvanic rust Direct contact in between dissimilar metals will start the formation of a galvanic cell, which is developed whenever 2 different types of metal are conductively linked to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be rusted and an electrical current is created because of the process. A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly linked to copper pipe. It is likewise worth noting that while using a brass fitting to bridge the space between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not completely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to alleviate this direct contact between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling includes an insulating material that physically separates contact in between the 2 metals.</p>

<p>As a locally-owned business, integrity and duty are incredibly crucial to developing a track record for quality. Section 312.10 of the Ohio Plumbing Code covers the installation, repairs and testing of isolation backflow preventers (BFP) and Section 608 of the Ohio Plumbing Code addresses security of the safe and clean water system within a building these devices are called seclusion" BFP. Once again, the best type of backflow prevention is an air space, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would stream over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to make sure there is an air gap, if there is no chance to offer one, then we inspect to see that the appropriate BFP device is installed. These BFP's, if testable, are needed to be evaluated (by a certified backflow preventer tester) upon installation and a minimum of every twelve months afterwards.</p>
<p>A continuous-feed garbage disposal is the most common type which continues to run as long as the power switch is on. A continuous-feed disposal is best for combating large amounts of food waste.

<p>All piping under faucets and sinks are looked for leaks or damage. How to tell if you have polybutylene pipes: If your pipes are white plastic and include the letters PB" in the printed label, you have polybutylene pipes and we suggest having them replaced right away. Before you can request an inspection, you should initially obtain the required license( s) for the work you intend to do. You can have a look at our License page to find out more on obtaining an authorization. Once you acquire a license you can begin with the work.

If bones or other hard foods get stuck in the disposal, it could cause it to jam and not work effectively. By running hot water through the disposal, you might have the ability to clear the clog yourself. However you run the risk of damaging the motor or blades.</p>

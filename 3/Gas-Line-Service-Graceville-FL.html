When the resin beads have maxed out their ability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be recharged (a procedure called regeneration).

Repiping is a procedure of setting up a new water line plumbing system. This process typically consists of eliminating old readily accessible pipes and then setting up the new plumbing system.

<p>The mineral tank is the chamber where the tough water is softened. The water supply line feeds the hard water into the tank. The water seeps through the bed of resin beads, transferring the water-hardening calcium and magnesium ions. The water exits the tank soft and flows through your pipes and out to your household devices. Backflow is a term utilized in the plumbing world to explain an unfavorable circulation of water in the reverse instructions. The backflow of water carries contaminants back to the primary water system system, making the water in it hazardous to consume.</p>

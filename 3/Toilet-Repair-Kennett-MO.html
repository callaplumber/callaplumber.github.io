<p>The most efficient way to resolve difficult water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are collected by tiny resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When tough water is available in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and changed with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>Gas companies typically do not charge for the initial see as their concern is to stop any gas leakages or problems. Your gas bills might be higher than typical if you have a small leak.

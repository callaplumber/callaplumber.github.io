<p>How to install or replace a garbage disposal. Sewer lines can fail for a range of reasons, including poor soil conditions, clogs from grease and grime, and corrosion.

<p>If the problems happens well outside that 8 to 12 year life-span, a guideline of thumb is that you can regain the cost of the repair. If, state, you need a new burner package and the hot water heater is 5 years of ages, then it makes sense for you to invest the $120 for the part, particularly if you can do the work yourself. The closer the appliance is to that 8 to 12-year limit, the more doubtful the economics of a repair becomes. The factor is that some other part on the home appliance will go or its tank will leak. And there's no cure for a leaking tank.</p>

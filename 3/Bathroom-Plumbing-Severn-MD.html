Likewise attach the dishwasher discharge tube to the inlet when you connect the P-trap.</p>
<p>A minimized pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is set up in high risk" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has 2 spring checks, however also has a third check valve that is really a vent open up to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is utilized in high-risk situations is because if the very first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve offers an extra layer of protection compared to the DC, which will permit backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the factor that when you evaluate an RPZ, you force water to backflow to make sure the RPZ discharges.</p>

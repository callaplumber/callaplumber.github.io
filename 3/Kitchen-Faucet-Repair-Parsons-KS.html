<p>Drawbacks to be familiar with is that hybrid water heaters need to be set up in an area that remains in between 40 to 90 degrees, or they will not work well. They need as much as 7 feet of clearance from the floor to ceiling, because the heatpump is on top of the water heater. Also, hybrids need as much as 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled space to catch enough heat from the air, and a drain in close distance to release the condensate.</p>

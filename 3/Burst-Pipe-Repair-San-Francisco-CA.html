<h3>Quality Plumbing Service San Francisco CA</h3>
<p>Our knowledgeable technicians have numerous systems and techniques of the trade that can actually lessen the effect on the house and prevent much of the wall and tile repair. From threading pipes through existing holes to specifically developed cover plates for shower valves, it may not be as invasive as you might believe. That being said, there are, of course, often times when we will be opening a wall to access piping. The bright side is that we can include wall repair in our scope so that you are not left trying to find multiple contractors to get the task finished.</p>
<p>The most typical technique for producing soft water is through ion exchange, a process in which the calcium and magnesium in the water are exchanged for another component, generally sodium. Salt will not cause lime scale or soap residue buildup like other minerals do, and water softening adds only a very small amount of salt to your water. According to the Mayo Center, an 8-ounce glass of soft water would have less than 12.5 milligrams of salt, which is considered extremely low sodium" by the Food and Drug Administration.</p>

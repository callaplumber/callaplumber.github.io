<p>The program accomplishes its objective by providing for the adoption and promulgation of suitable guidelines and policies for the building and construction of plumbing facilities where mandated. Cold showers? High energy bills? It may be time for a new hot water heater. But in order to reap the benefits of a brand-new energy-efficient home appliance, you'll need to have it set up appropriately. A hot water heater that is not set up properly can lead to water damage, scalding temperatures, or perhaps a fire. That's why installation is best left to professional plumbers who understand the ins and outs of your plumbing system.</p>

<p>The discharge tube included in the disposer kit will be connected to the disposer using the plate, gasket and screws originally meant for the disposer discharge elbow. If your package only includes a waste arm, it is possible - though not recommended - to connect this to the disposer discharge elbow using a slip joint. The consecutive 90 ° turns in such a setup can result in incorrect drainage. Depending on the length of the waste arm, you may have the ability to cut off its elbow and utilize the remainder as a straight discharge tube.</p>

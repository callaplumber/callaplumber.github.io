<p>Backflow implies the unfavorable turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the safe and clean water system; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from occurring. Points at which a drinkable water supply connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, however they need to be carefully developed and set up to avoid backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>

The unique nozzle connected to the hose directs the water in all directions to permit the water to cover the entire diameter of the sewer line and provide a careful cleaning.</p>

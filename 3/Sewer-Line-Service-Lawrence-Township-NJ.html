<p>Odd Sounds - If uncommon gurgling is coming from your drain, it probably needs a comprehensive cleaning. When food or waste clog your drains, it makes it tough for the water to travel through. The pipes often make strange gurgling sounds as water efforts to pass through a clogged pipe since of the tight space. This triggers the water to bubble, as only little pockets of air are available, leading to the unusual noises emanating from your sink.</p>
<p>Jamming or Clogged: For the most part, a garbage disposal is only equipped to handle softer natural waste. It might trigger it to jam and not work correctly if bones or other hard foods get stuck in the disposal. By running hot water through the disposal, you may be able to clear the clog yourself.

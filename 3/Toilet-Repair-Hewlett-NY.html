<p>In the meantime, however, we suggest you first try utilizing non-harsh and non-abrasive white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Merely pour a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, add some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mix sit for a while. If that doesn't work, you can attempt a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner. Many of these cleaners include concentrated levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be extremely harmful if it comes in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. Please ensure to take the proper precautions if using one of these items.</p>

<p>Sewer linings can assist to repair broken pipes without having to completely replace your sewer lines or damage the area around them. Daily use should not cause a water softener to leak.

If you reside in an earthquake-prone area of the nation, protect the softener so that if the foundation begins moving, the softener does not tip over and rip out the plumbing. You must wait up until after the cycle is completed and then inspected the system for fractures or broken fittings if your water softener is leaking throughout regrowth.

Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can produce boosts in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Decreases in potable supply of water pressure take place whenever the amount of water being used exceeds the quantity of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>

A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly linked to copper pipe. It is likewise worth keeping in mind that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the gap between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it likewise will not totally avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to reduce this direct contact between the dissimilar metals.

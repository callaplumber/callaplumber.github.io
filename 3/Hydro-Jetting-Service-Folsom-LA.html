<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumber In Folsom LA</h3>
<p>These guys were fantastic! They showed up early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been an issue on and off for many years now. It was installed 7 years back, and it never ever drained this well. I chose this company due to the fact that they had excellent evaluations and a reasonable cost, and even though the task took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a substantial, revolting mess on their hands (literally), and they did a terrific task cleaning up after it as well.</p>

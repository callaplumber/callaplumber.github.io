It's important to comprehend that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much higher pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Fluctuations in line pressure, downstream or upstream, will trigger an effectively functioning RPZ assembly to occasionally discharge small amounts of water. Throughout a backflow condition, a large volume of water will stream from the relief valve. For this factor, RPZ assemblies should not be installed in locations subject to water damage. Adequate drainage should also be supplied.</p>

<p>When the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the inbound safe and clean water supply, backpressure backflow in a structure results. Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature level increases in boilers, or if there is a decline in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when unfavorable or decreased pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, normally due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A common type of backflow preventer is the lowered pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>

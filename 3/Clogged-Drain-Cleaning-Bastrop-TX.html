<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable water system pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can create boosts in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in drinkable supply of water pressure happen whenever the amount of water being used exceeds the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water pipe.</p>

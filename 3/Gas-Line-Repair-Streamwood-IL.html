<p>Sewer linings can help to repair broken pipes without having to entirely replace your sewer lines or ruin the area around them. Due to the fact that it is a large task that is typically perceived as an unneeded expense, many homeowners prevent repiping their houses. Why repipe your home when repairing it is possible?

At Legendary Plumbing, we provide homeowners with individualized, affordable repiping options in Pearland and beyond.</p>
<p>Do not put whatever down your waste disposal unit. It's important to watch what you put down your waste disposal unit. Foods like rice and pasta can swell when blended with water, and possibly trigger a clog. Vegetables and fruit peels can also trigger jams and obstructions - think about composting or placing these products in the garbage. Furthermore, grease and oil can harden and gather in your drain too. After finishing cooking, think about putting leftover grease or oil into a jar or bowl to reserve. You can then reheat and utilize for other cooking or easily place in the garbage after it's hardened.</p>

<p>Sewer linings can help to repair broken pipes without needing to completely replace your sewer lines or destroy the area around them. Daily usage should not trigger a water softener to leak. Leakages can also happen if you run into the softener and jostle it, pulling the fitting apart. To avoid this from occurring, install the unit in a safe and steady  area. If you live in an earthquake-prone area of the country, secure the softener so that if the structure begins moving, the softener doesn't fall over and rip out the plumbing. If your water softener is leaking during regrowth, you ought to wait until after the cycle is completed and then inspected the system for cracks or broken fittings. You need to likewise check to make sure your drain line is never blocked up with particles. A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener throughout regrowth and flood your basement or garage.</p>

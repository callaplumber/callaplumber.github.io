If your water softener is leaking during regrowth, you ought to wait until after the cycle is completed and then inspected the system for cracks or broken fittings. You need to likewise check to make sure your drain line is never blocked up with particles. A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener throughout regrowth and flood your basement or garage.</p>

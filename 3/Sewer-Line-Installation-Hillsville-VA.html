Installing a backflow prevention valves will help you to protect your tenants and comply with the law.</p>
<p>The source or place of a sewer problem determines who pays for repair. The City is accountable for the public right-of-way (curb to curb), from one side of the street to another. The property owner is accountable for the area from the curb to the back of their residential or commercial property line. Easements (normally 10 feet wide) where main drains pass through personal property are an exception to this rule.</p>

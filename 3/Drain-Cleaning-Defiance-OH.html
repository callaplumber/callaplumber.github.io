<p>Changing your sink is a step-by-step process. Measure, cut, and link the pipes. Prior to attaching any pipes to your water softener, measure and cut your pipes to fit. Solder on any nipples and fittings prior to linking the unit to the bypass valve to prevent melting the plastic if you are using copper pipes. Seal all threads with plumber's tape. Plastic tubing like PEX can also be utilized. Though it may require extra adapters, flexible tubing is far easier to work with and can make use of push-to-connect fittings, conserving you time and the hassle of soldering.</p>

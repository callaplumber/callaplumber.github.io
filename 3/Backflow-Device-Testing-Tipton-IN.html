Such connections take place naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashers, but they need to be carefully designed and installed to prevent backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>

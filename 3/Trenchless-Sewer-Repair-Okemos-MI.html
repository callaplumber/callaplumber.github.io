<p>When the drinkable supply piping is linked to a system or component which exceeds the operating pressure of the supply piping, backpressure might take place. Higher pressure can be caused by booster pumps, boilers, pressure vessels, or elevated piping in places such as high-rise buildings or tanks. If these connections are not effectively secured, potable and non-potable water or liquids can be pushed into the potable supply system.</p>
<p>Fire department connections can be a problem when utilized in combating a fire. Firefighters by and large are not worried about backflow prevention issues. They are concerning with securing people's lives and to a lower extent their home. Getting the needed volume of water on a fire is their mission and they will use water from any source readily available to achieve that goal. This can produce cross-connection control problems and may as a result mean that the level of protection on the fire security system may need to be increased to a high risk protection level.</p>
<p>The Plumbing Bureau's primary focus is on safety within a structure. Plumbing inspections ensure that water systems in structures are linked correctly, without any cross-connection to infect safe and clean water supply. Components should be appropriately caught, to prevent sewer gas from leaving into a structures. Hot water heaters are also checked to make sure that they have actually been set up correctly, to prevent a surge.</p>

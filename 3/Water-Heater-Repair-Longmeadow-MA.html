<p>An overall repipe of a house's water system, typically done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most elaborate and expensive plumbing task, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company specializing in whole house repiping. Current Review: Carlos and Lopez were fantastic. My 90 years of age Dad's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos arrived at 8am the next day to repair. Because of the age of the home and location of the pipe, it was a hard task. They worked for nearly 12 hours into darkness to make certain the system was working before they left. I am genuinely grateful for their effort and professionalism.</p>

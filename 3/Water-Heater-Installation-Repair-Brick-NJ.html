<p>Water softening utilizes a procedure called "ion exchange" to eliminate liquified tough water minerals such as calcium, magnesium, manganese and iron. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular reaction is needed. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto sodium, and as the tough water streams through the resin, the sodium is swapped for the hard water minerals. The tough water minerals are trapped in a trace and the softener quantity of sodium flows out with the softened water.</p>

By turning a valve, you can bypass the softener in case you need to offer some kind of maintenance to it or perhaps while you're dealing with installing it.

<p>A reduced pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is installed in high threat" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has two spring checks, but also has a third check valve that is actually a vent open up to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is used in high-risk situations is since if the very first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains. This relief valve provides an additional layer of security compared to the DC, which will enable backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the reason that when you check an RPZ, you force water to backflow to ensure the RPZ discharges.</p>

<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable water system pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can produce increases in downstream pressure; temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in drinkable water supply pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being used goes beyond the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water mains.</p>

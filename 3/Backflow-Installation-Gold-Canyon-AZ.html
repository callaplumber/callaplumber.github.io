Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature boosts in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when negative or lower pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, generally due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity.

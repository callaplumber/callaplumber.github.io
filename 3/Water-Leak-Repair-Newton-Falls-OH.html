<p>As soon as the elements are put back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is ready to be pressurized. It is necessary to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the downside turned off stays in the closed position. This allows the parts to move to their pressurized positions in a precise movement. As soon as the assembly is pressurized, then any collected air must be removed from the body. Many backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be eliminated from critical areas in the assembly. In some designs, test dicks can be utilized to eliminate air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in an area where the air will build up.</p>
<p>If you think your toilet has a leak, the good news is that it doesn't always require a repair of your entire unit. A toilet's tank is made up of several little moving parts, such as flapper valves and fill valves, that need to be changed or fixed due to their frequent use. When these parts wear out, they result in small leaks that are difficult to see with the naked eye. This is why it is important to call a plumber as soon as you think you have a leak or a broken tank part. Not only does a leaking toilet drainage, it can also result in flooding and water damage.</p>

<p>Agilent's variety of leak detection solutions make sure the security, security and constant performance of research, vacuum, and commercial procedure systems. Examining the water meter is a great next action in your plumbing inspection. Close all faucets and check if the water meter is turning. If it is, there is a leak somewhere and this might be severe issue. Move on to the valves. Start with the main turned off valve operation. When turned off, no faucet in the house ought to have water. This goes for every other turned off valve and their corresponding faucets. You are off to a great start if whatever is working appropriately.</p>
<p>The person who does the testing should be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this certification, and a plumbing license is not required to obtain this certification. I have actually checked with a couple of plumbers, and the prices quoted for backflow testing ranged from $150 - $250, but I would expect the cost to be significantly less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>

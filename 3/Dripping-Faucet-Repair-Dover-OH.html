Dual Checks have losses similar to Double Checks (5 PSI).</p>

<p>Every water heater we install has been evaluated under the most severe water temperatures and was built to last a long time. When your existing water heater begins failing, a new installation may cost cash up front, but it can conserve you hundreds and even countless dollars in the long run. Effectiveness and resilience are key components of every water heater we sell. That's why citizens of Centreville, Fairfax, Herndon, Reston, Leesburg, and other parts of Northern Virginia have actually been using Service Specialties for water heater installations for nearly 40 years now.

<p>Deluge systems are developed so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems typically are set up in areas where the possibility of a severe fire condition is likely, such as aircraft hangars. Water to the system is kept back by the deluge valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire takes place, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then permits water to release from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>

<p>With tank hot water heaters, you have a considerable tank that heats up and holds water. The heating element can be via making use of electrical energy, gas, or oil. The gas hot water heater utilize natural gas or LPG to heat the water. The gas designs are likewise less expensive to run than the electrical types and are a favorite for commercial and residential functions.

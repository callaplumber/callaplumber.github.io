<h3>Water Heater Maintenance in Nevada Missouri</h2>
<p>A general rule is that you can regain the cost of the repair if the problems happens well outside that 8 to 12 year life expectancy.

The closer the appliance is to that 8 to 12-year limit, the more doubtful the economics of a repair ends up being. The reason is that some other part on the appliance will go or its tank will leak. And there's no remedy for a leaking tank.</p>

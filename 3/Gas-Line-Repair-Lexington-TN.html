In addition, SACr is a major advancement over present anti-scaling innovations consisting of template assisted condensation by allowing for the real physical decrease of calcium and magnesium ion concentrations. Your kitchen might end up being clogged by food or grease, while in the bathroom it may be hair or pieces of soap that trigger the clog.

<p>Water softening utilizes a procedure called "ion exchange" to eliminate liquified tough water minerals such as calcium, iron, manganese and magnesium. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular reaction is needed. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto salt, and as the difficult water flows through the resin, the sodium is switched for the difficult water minerals. The tough water minerals are caught in a trace and the softener amount of sodium drains with the softened water.</p>

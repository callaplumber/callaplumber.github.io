<p>The best source for this type of plumber is a basic contractor. The contractor sees the plumber's work before it's covered; you don't get that opportunity. In addition, your contractor understands the indications of quality work that you may miss, like clean solder joints, crisp 90-degree angles at joints and clean, appropriately sized holes in joists, floors, and studs. Lastly, a quality contractor will not threat working with a substandard plumber. A simple mistake-- a joint left unsoldered or a leaky PVC line-- can easily devastate $10,000 worth of walls or hardwood floors and make complex the task with insurance claims, lost time, and suits. With so much riding on the plumber, contractors tend to stick to just the best.</p>
<p>Your service provider will call when the installer is on the way, typically about an hour prior to the scheduled visit time. Upon arrival, a trusted professional will provide their Home Depot Service Provider badge, and carry out the initial walkthrough to validate the scope of work. Once you agree to move forward, the installation can begin. This normally only takes a couple of hours, but if there are unanticipated scenarios, your provider may need to return the following day.</p>

<p>I can't say enough good ideas about this company. Had a sewer repair needed and had a really short quantity of time due to closing on a home sale. Each and every single individual I encountered from Marquita doing logistics for my job to every member of the work crew. Friendly, interacted well, completely responsive and actually cared to assist me through this very stressful job. All of individuals I came across were good example for what a well run service company need to be. Much thanks and gratitude. You're excellent.</p>
<p>The source or location of a sewer problem determines who spends for repair. The City is responsible for the general public right of way (curb to suppress), from one side of the street to another. The homeowner is responsible for the area from the curb to the back of their residential or commercial property line. Easements (generally 10 feet wide) where main sewage systems traverse personal property are an exception to this rule.</p>
<p>Do not use ground joint unions except straight at the meter or after the shutoff valve at the home appliance. Each location where you will have a gas device must have a gas shutoff valve. Within the City of Seattle just, any person who installs gas piping on home not under their ownership must possess a Seattle Gas Piping Mechanic License. All gas piping setups require a permit and inspection.</p>

<p>Your old discharge tube probably won't be the right length for your new disposal. If it's too long, merely connect it to the disposal, mark it and cut it with a hacksaw for your garbage disposal installation. (Loosen the other pipe connections, if necessary, to insert television back into the tee.) If the old discharge tube is too brief, you might need to make a time-wasting trip to the store.

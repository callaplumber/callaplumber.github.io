<p>If a cable has not yet been run to the junction box, you can make the connections within the brand-new disposer at any time in advance, joining the cable television to the wires in the box just before or simply after mounting the disposer. Garbage disposals are pretty easy to keep. The most essential thing to keep in mind is that they are truly food disposals. Items that would otherwise go in the garbage needs to not be put in your disposal. This includes glass, plastic, metals (yes, silverware), paper, anything combustible, bleach, drain cleaners, and toys.</p>
<p>Carefully listen and lift the rod if your flapper valve has a ball that drifts at the end of a rod. If the water turns off, you might be able to stop the running by adjusting the float. Some fill toilet valves have a float change screw on top (see Figure A below). If there is no adjustment screw, flex the float arm. Make sure it's adjusted appropriately (Image 8)if you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve. You don't have to empty the tank to make these adjustments.</p>
<p>Though it's not constantly necessary, often the plumber may have to repair or upgrade wiring to power the brand-new waste disposal unit. This normally costs an extra $50 to $100+. The pilot burner may need to be relit, the gas line may be clogged or need repair. The flowers or plants near the gas leak will be stained or degraded if the gas line is damaged. Contact our specialists to identify the level of the problem.</p>

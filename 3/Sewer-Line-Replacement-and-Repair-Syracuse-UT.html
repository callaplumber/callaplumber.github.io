<p>A partial reroute is generally a little scale repiping of one or more afflicted areas of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost reliable, it is possible to only desert the afflicted section of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, attics and ceilings. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can add up in cost very quickly. This is the main reason that we will recommend a complete repipe in specific neighborhoods, based upon our experience.</p>

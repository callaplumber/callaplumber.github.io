<p>A lowered pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is set up in high risk" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has two spring checks, but also has a 3rd check valve that is really a vent open to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is utilized in high-risk situations is because if the very first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve offers an additional layer of security compared to the DC, which will enable backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the reason that when you check an RPZ, you require water to backflow to make certain the RPZ discharges.</p>

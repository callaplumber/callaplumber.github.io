A clogged sewer line can lead to a raw sewage backup out of your drains, which can trigger considerable problems and damage-- specifically typical in older homes.

<p>Your waste disposal unit guarantees that your sink and plumbing components do not get clogged. Contrary to some people's understanding, garbage disposals do not include blades. Instead, a waste disposal unit includes two fixed bolts that are fixed to a spinning disk. When the disposal is switched on the disks rapidly spin, and these bolts force food and particles to grind against a stationary grinder along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action effectively crushes the food waste in the disposal so that it can take a trip down the drain without obstructing.</p>

<p>Backpressure backflow in a building results when the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the incoming safe and clean supply of water. Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature level boosts in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when negative or decreased pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, typically due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A common type of backflow preventer is the lowered pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>

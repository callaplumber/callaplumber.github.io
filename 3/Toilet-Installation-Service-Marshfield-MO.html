<p>These people were fantastic! They appeared early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been an issue off and on for years now. It was set up 7 years back, and it never ever drained this well. I picked this company since they had terrific evaluations and a fair price, and although the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a huge, horrible mess on their hands (actually), and they did a terrific job cleaning up after it as well.</p>

Consult your water softener dealership for details on resin replacement.</p>
<p>In addition to backflow prevention valves, Sprinkler Warehouse also carries a large variety of backflow prevention devices. These devices include backflow prevention system accessories, backflow device enclosures, test packages, repair parts, and insulated pouches.

Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the firmness ions-- are gathered by tiny resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When tough water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and changed with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>

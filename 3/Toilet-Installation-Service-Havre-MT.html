<p>Sewer lines have one essential function: carry wastewater out of a house or structure. The majority of folks replace their water heaters due to poor efficiency, complete failure or as a preventive step. If your hot water heater is more than 10 years old, it's time to consider replacing it with a more efficient model. Water on the floor can indicate used parts. Your plumber may replace the tank-to-bowl connections, or the gasket around the floor hole.

The cost of the water softener system is considerably exceeded by the money and energy saved.</p>

While this may work in the short term, remember that the weakened pipe is made of the exact same material as other pipes in your house, suggesting that trouble might be brewing elsewhere in your plumbing system. Repiping now will give you comfort and avoid larger leaks down the road.</p>

<p>Garbage Disposal Installation Fed Up With False Guarantees? Water distributes in the tank where small resin beads switch the calcium and magnesium in the water for the sodium or potassium they're holding.

When the resin beads have maxed out their ability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be charged (a procedure called regeneration). During this process, the resin beads are washed with the highly focused saltwater solution (salt water) from the tank (made from the salt you added to the tank). The brine forces the calcium and magnesium ions to be released from the beads and changed with salt or potassium ions.</p>

<p>You rely on your drains to bring wastewater from your sink, shower or tub. Gradually, the drains become clogged with residue such as mineral sediment, food, hair, grease and more. These products collect in the drain and ultimately harden versus the pipe walls, making them hard to eliminate. Your hot water heater is leaking: Hot water heater leaks are among the most common signs that your system is at completion of its lifespan, particularly if they are triggering major flooding or are originating from the tank itself.</p>
<p>If you hear water running in your toilet and you believe a leaky toilet tank or toilet bowl, attempt this: squirt a couple of drops of food coloring to the toilet tank and let the toilet sit for about half an hour. After 30 minutes, check to see if any of the water in your toilet bowl has changed color. You most likely have a leak if it has.</p>

For house, it is important for owners to inform the District if any changes are made, such as digging a new well.

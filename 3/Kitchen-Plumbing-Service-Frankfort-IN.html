<p>Without a plumbing camera inspection, a lot of drain problems can just be spotted once they begin to back up. However, throughout routing plumbing inspections, a full test of all drains will be carried out. If something may be happening behind the walls or in the ground, plumbers can attempt to recreate problems to figure out.

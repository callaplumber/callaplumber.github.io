<p>Some pipe materials are cheaper than others; some are more susceptible and fragile to splitting, displacement or other types of structural failure. Other products are vulnerable to rust and rust while some are unaffected. Specific pipe materials have greater coefficients of heat pressure, making them more vulnerable to structural stresses and pressures as an outcome of temperature change and ice formation. And these differences dictate the prospective need for backflow preventers.</p>
<p>The next criteria to evaluate is how the backflow prevention assembly is set up. It is necessary that the repair specialist understands the correct installation orientation and can examine the installation conditions to ensure there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly should be set up in the installation orientation for which it was authorized. Most backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, but it is essential that the assembly just be installed if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work appropriately and no matter the number of parts you put inside the assembly, it still might not work because the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>

<p>Given that presenting a mechanical pipe repair products over 100 years back, Dresser has actually broadened its repair line of product to consist of clamps and weldable sleeves for the energy industry. A pipe leak test should be carried out, then there are 2 ways to proceed. The first is with trenchless repair. The second is with a traditional technique.

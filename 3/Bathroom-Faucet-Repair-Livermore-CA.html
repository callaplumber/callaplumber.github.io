Changes in line pressure, upstream or downstream, will trigger a correctly working RPZ assembly to periodically release percentages of water. Throughout a backflow condition, a big volume of water will stream from the relief valve. For this factor, RPZ assemblies should not be set up in areas subject to water damage. Appropriate drainage must also be supplied.</p>

The field test may not always show you the severity of the failure or whether repair parts beyond the basic rubber repair kit are needed. There might be additional test procedures, beyond those established in the tester accreditation program, that can supply information revealing the intensity of the failure that could help in the diagnostic analysis of the backflow prevention assembly.</p>

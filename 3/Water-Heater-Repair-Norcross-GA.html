<p>The U-shaped pipe underneath kitchen and bathroom sinks is something that people anticipate to see but seldom stop to think of. The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you flip the switch, however it doesn't grind up food, this implies the flywheel is stuck. Attempt freeing the jam by inserting a hex wrench of the correct size into the hole on the bottom of the waste disposal unit. At the same time, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom handle (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>
<p>Filtration in sink taps and refrigerator water dispensers improves water's taste, but its steep price makes it unwise as a household service.

Points at which a drinkable water system connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they should be thoroughly developed and set up to avoid backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>

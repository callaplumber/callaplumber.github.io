<p>A lowered pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is set up in high risk" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has two spring checks, but also has a third check valve that is really a vent available to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is used in high-risk circumstances is due to the fact that if the very first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve uses an extra layer of security compared to the DC, which will permit backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the factor that when you test an RPZ, you require water to backflow to make sure the RPZ discharges.</p>

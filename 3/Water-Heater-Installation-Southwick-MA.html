When the test results reveal the repair is total, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was isolated throughout the repair procedure. It is necessary that the plumbing system be turned on very slowly to guarantee no damage is done to the piping system. Once the system is pressurized, air must be removed from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system must be examined to guarantee no valves were mistakenly left open or did not close properly when re-pressurized. When the plumbing system is pressurized, make certain all valves are entirely open and inform the water user that the plumbing system has been returned to service.</p>

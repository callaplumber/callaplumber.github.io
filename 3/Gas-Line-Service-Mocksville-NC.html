<p>Clark's Process: This procedure is also called lime softening. The chemical calcium hydroxide, called limewater, is contributed to water, which causes the solidity ions to precipitate. The alkalinity of the water is raised through this addition to above 9.6, so co2 should be contributed to re-carbonate the water and bring the pH back down.

<p>Loose flanges are normally the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws just will not keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best option depends upon the level of the rot. If the rot is just under the flange, use an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into company wood farther away from the flange. Before you install this kind of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might have to cut off a number of ears to make it work with your toilet. You'll have to replace an area of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>

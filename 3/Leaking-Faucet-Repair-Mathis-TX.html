<p>Viking SupplyNet's extensive stock of backflow valves and related devices consists of leading products from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the public supply of water react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and become fragile. This leads to micro-fractures and decreases the standard structural integrity of the system. The system ends up being weak and might fail without caution, causing damage to the building structure and personal effects. Improper installation is likewise a typical reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly impossible to spot.</p>
<p>Each element of the assembly must be checked to determine what requires repair. The field test might not always reveal you the intensity of the failure or whether repair parts beyond the fundamental rubber repair package are necessary. There might be extra test procedures, beyond those established in the tester accreditation program, that can supply data revealing the seriousness of the failure that could help in the diagnostic analysis of the backflow prevention assembly.</p>

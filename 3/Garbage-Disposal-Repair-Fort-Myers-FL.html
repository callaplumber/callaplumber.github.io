<h3>Emergency Plumbing Repair Fort Myers FL</h3>
<p>Another typical argument against the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't reverse through them, so the valves must avoid backflow.  The obvious issue with this is that if the backflow takes place at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A basic manually operated valve must stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if totally closed, has great seals, and does not leak.  However most of the automated valves, such as the electrical solenoid valves utilized for watering systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and fully closed.</p>

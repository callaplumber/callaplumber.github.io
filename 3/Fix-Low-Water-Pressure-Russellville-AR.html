<p>Figuring out if you need a water softener is an individual preference. Water softener systems work by getting rid of hardness minerals and replacing them with salt ions. Water conditioners are gadgets that help avoid the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They use a physical media to inhibit the scale from building up by reducing the effects of the hardness itself. Due to the fact that water conditioners utilize a physical media instead of a chemical media, they are in some cases thought about a greener option in areas where it is forbidden to use salt. Water conditioners do not successfully remove hardness from the water supply, however, as the only way to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>

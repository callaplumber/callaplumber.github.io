Hard water also makes it more difficult to clean soap off your body, or shampoo out of your hair, which can lead to dandruff and itchiness of your skin or scalp. If you have chronically dry skin or eczema, you'll likely discover that tough water causes your skin to flake, itch, and redden typically.</p>

The pipe is a plastic product that will be resistant to root invasion for as much as 100 years.</p>

<p>A. The toilet fill valve measurements we reveal are measured from the within bottom of the tank to the top of the fill valve. The threaded water supply shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not consisted of in this measurement. The addition of a backflow preventer minimizes water service pressure to the building; extra, more substantial costs can occur if the drop in water pressure ends up being a concern for homeowners. If setting up a pump or bigger size water service and backflow prevention device would neutralize the pressure loss, a PE or RA can help figure out.</p>
<p>Numerous homeowners will use a store-bought chemical drain cleaner to fix their filthy or clogged drain issues.

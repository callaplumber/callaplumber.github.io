<p>Your kitchen sink is an essential part of your home, which makes its plumbing's effective working a need more than a need.

As soon as the system is pressurized, air should be eliminated from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system must be checked to ensure no valves were inadvertently exposed or did not close properly when re-pressurized. As soon as the plumbing system is pressurized, make sure all valves are totally open and notify the water user that the plumbing system has actually been gone back to service.</p>

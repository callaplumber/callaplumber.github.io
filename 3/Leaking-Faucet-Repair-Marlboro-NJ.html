<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can develop increases in downstream pressure; temperature level boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in drinkable supply of water pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being used exceeds the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water mains.</p>

<p>Sewer linings can assist to repair split pipes without having to totally replace your sewer lines or ruin the area around them. Daily use must not trigger a water softener to leak. Leaks can also happen if you bump into the softener and scramble it, pulling the fitting apart. To avoid this from occurring, install the system in a steady and safe place. If you reside in an earthquake-prone area of the country, secure the softener so that if the structure begins moving, the softener does not fall over and rip out the plumbing. You should wait until after the cycle is completed and then inspected the system for fractures or broken fittings if your water softener is leaking throughout regrowth. You should also examine to make certain your drain line is never ever blocked up with particles. A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener during regrowth and flood your basement or garage.</p>

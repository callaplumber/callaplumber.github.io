<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Echologics has a long history of establishing award-winning acoustic innovations for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a video camera through the household sewer pipes (usually from the house to its connection to the public sewer system) can be utilized to evaluate the type and condition of underground pipes, and to determine problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, obstructions, corrosion or collapsed pipes. Property owners may have a video inspection done to find the cause of regular sewer backups or other continuous problems, or when offering or purchasing an older home.</p>
<p>Inspect Valves and Double Checks. There are two other kinds of backflow preventers available that you may run into. The first is a check valve. The second is a double check". It is NOT the exact same thing as a Check even though it may be marketed as one! Don't get duped! Pressure loss through a check valve tends to be about 3 PSI. Dual Checks have losses comparable to Check (5 PSI).</p>

<p>Light Blue = Lowered Pressure Zone - supply pressure pushes open the # 1 check and is lowered by the # 1 Check spring (for example, to 90 psi). This pressure distinction throughout the # 1 check valve keeps the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone rises towards the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, preventing backflow (reverse motion of fluid).</p>

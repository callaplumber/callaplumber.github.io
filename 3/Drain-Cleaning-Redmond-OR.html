<p>In water distribution systems, water is typically maintained at a substantial pressure to make it possible for water to flow from the tap, shower, or other component. Water pressure may be or fail reduced when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is unexpectedly high need on the water system (for example, when several fire hydrants are opened). Reduced pressure in the pipe may allow contaminated water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be prepared into the system.</p>

Such connections happen naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, however they must be carefully created and set up to avoid backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>

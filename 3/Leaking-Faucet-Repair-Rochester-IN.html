<p>Your kitchen sink is an essential part of your house, that makes its plumbing's efficient functioning a need more than a need. When the test results show the repair is total, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated throughout the repair process. It is very important that the plumbing system be turned on extremely slowly to assure no damage is done to the piping system. As soon as the system is pressurized, air should be gotten rid of from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system must be checked to ensure no valves were unintentionally left open or did not close properly when re-pressurized. As soon as the plumbing system is pressurized, make certain all valves are entirely open and notify the water user that the plumbing system has been returned to service.</p>

<p>The next criteria to examine is how the backflow prevention assembly is set up. It is essential that the repair technician knows the right installation orientation and can assess the installation conditions to ensure there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly need to be set up in the installation orientation for which it was approved. The majority of backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, but it is necessary that the assembly only be set up if it is authorized for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may trigger the backflow prevention assembly to not work properly and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still might not work due to the fact that the installation orientation is causing the failure.</p>

<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable water supply pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can create increases in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in safe and clean water system pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being utilized goes beyond the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water mains.</p>

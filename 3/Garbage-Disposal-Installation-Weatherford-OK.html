<p>Sooner or later, nevertheless, the beads reach maximum capacity and can't attract any more mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank should be restored, or, flushed clean. That's where the salt water tank comes in. An on-board computer determines the amount of water that streams through the softener. Regrowth immediately begins when it reaches the preprogrammed setting. For a three-bedroom home and family of 4, regrowth typically occurs every 12,000 gallons.</p>
<p>Nearly all softeners fall under one of two categories. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will regenerate on a fixed schedule and then go back to service. Because they regenerate whether the resin needs it or not, these work well for homes that are on routine water-using cycles but will lose more water and salt. Demand-control designs, with either electrical and mechanical sensing units, normally regenerate after so many gallons of water have actually been softened. Such designs are hassle-free if you have a changing water use schedule.</p>

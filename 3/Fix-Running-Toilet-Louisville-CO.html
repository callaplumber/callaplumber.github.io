<p>Water softening utilizes a process called "ion exchange" to remove liquified tough water minerals such as calcium, iron, manganese and magnesium. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular reaction is required.

The difficult water minerals are trapped in the softener and a trace quantity of salt flows out with the softened water.</p>

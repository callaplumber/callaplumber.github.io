It has 2 spring checks, but likewise has a third check valve that is actually a vent open to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is utilized in high-risk situations is due to the fact that if the first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve offers an additional layer of protection compared to the DC, which will permit backflow if both check valves breakdown.

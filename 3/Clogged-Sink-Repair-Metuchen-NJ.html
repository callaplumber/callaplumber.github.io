<p>In addition to water softening systems, Rinckey said that reverse osmosis systems (ROs) are quite popular with homeowners in the area. He noted that there are particular contaminants that homeowners are dealing with and an RO can help reduce those concerns. Due to being mainly farming in Montcalm and Ionia counties, some property owners are setting up ROs to rid their water source of nitrates that are an item of farming waste. Rinckey kept in mind that these systems remove around 94 percent of nitrates. Arsenic also naturally happens in some soils and that too can be treated with the ideal RO system.</p>

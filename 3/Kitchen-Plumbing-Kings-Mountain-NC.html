<p>Your kitchen sink is an important part of your home, which makes its plumbing's efficient functioning a need more than a need. When the test results show the repair is total, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated throughout the repair procedure. It is very important that the plumbing system be turned on very slowly to ensure no damage is done to the piping system. Once the system is pressurized, air needs to be removed from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system must be examined to guarantee no valves were accidentally exposed or did not close appropriately when re-pressurized. As soon as the plumbing system is pressurized, be sure all valves are completely open and notify the water user that the plumbing system has actually been gone back to service.</p>

<p>When a flush valve triggers a toilet to run, a worn flapper is typically the perpetrator. However not constantly. Initially, look at the chain that raises the flapper.

Picture 3 shows how to set the slack just right.</p>
<p>Central Ohio Gas Line Services LLC focuses on the installation and repair of commercial and residential gas and propane gas lines, water service lines, gas line troubleshooting and assessment services. If your commercial home already has a backflow preventer, you're responsible for having it tested every year by a third-party Backflow Tester from our Authorized Tester List We will notify you by mail when it's time for your backflow test.</p>
<p>In some cases, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as simple as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he generates data on the workings of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's task to understand what the field test information suggests for that particular assembly.  When an experienced tester interprets the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>

<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in Winnsboro TX 75494?</h3>
<p>Backflow indicates the unwanted reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the potable water supply; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from taking place. Points at which a potable water system connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they must be carefully designed and set up to avoid backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>

<p>The most reliable way to attend to tough water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are gathered by tiny resin beads through a process called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When difficult water is available in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and replaced with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>This is a sign you might need a toilet repair or replacement if you are discovering yourself flushing the toilet more than regular (or even more than when).

These materials gather in the drain and ultimately harden versus the pipe walls, making them challenging to get rid of. Your hot water heater is leaking: Hot water heater leakages are one of the most common indications that your system is at the end of its lifespan, especially if they are causing significant flooding or are coming from the tank itself.</p>

<p>Test for water tightness by plugging the drain with the stopper and filling the sink with an inch of water.

Check for leakages and tighten up as essential. Plug unit into a GFCI-protected receptacle, and organize cables as preferred.</p>
<p>Storm drains are an integral part in a sophisticated system that has been designed and crafted to take all of the floodwaters and run off from rainstorms and channel it safely into the cities drainage systems.

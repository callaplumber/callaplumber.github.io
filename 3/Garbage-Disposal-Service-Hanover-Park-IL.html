<h3>How to Remove a Sink Drain Pop Up in Hanover Park IL 60133</h3>
<p>Backflow indicates the unwanted turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the drinkable water system; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from taking place. Points at which a potable water system connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they should be carefully created and set up to prevent backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>

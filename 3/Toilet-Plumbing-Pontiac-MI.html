Water softening is achieved with SACr by using proprietary polymer beads to produce insoluble carbonate crystals from calcium and magnesium bicarbonates. The beads accelerate the growth of carbonate crystals, which can be filtered to completely get rid of short-lived solidity in water.</p>
<p>Learn more about our current specials on plumbing, rooter, sewer, drain service and more. You'll notice the difference the very first time you shower or bathe with softened water. Soft water feels noticeably smooth to the skin. It also makes your house simple to clean by reducing hard-water accumulation.

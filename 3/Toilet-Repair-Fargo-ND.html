AVB's can be plastic or brass and either manual or electrical. Unlike other backflow preventers, AVBs are installed on each zone of the watering system, instantly after the zone control valve.</p>
<p>In some cases, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as basic as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he produces information on the operations of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's responsibility to know what the field test information implies for that particular assembly.  When a trained tester interprets the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>

<p>No other room in a house includes as many pipes and plumbing fixtures as the bathroom. Prevention is better than cure.

The closer the device is to that 8 to 12-year limitation, the more uncertain the economics of a repair becomes. The factor is that some other part on the appliance will go or its tank will leak. And there's no remedy for a leaking tank.</p>

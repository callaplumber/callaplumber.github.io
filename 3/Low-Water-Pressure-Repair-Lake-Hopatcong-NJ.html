<p>Leaky faucets and clogged drains are the most common sink repair problems. Common sufficient that many people opt for diy repairs. However sometimes even determining the leak can be a problem. It could be the shutoff valve, the faucet, a spray hose, garbage disposal fittings, the edge of the sink itself, or any part of the drain-- tailpiece, extension tube, slip extension, elbows, T joints, or the U or J trap.</p>
<p>The best source for this type of plumber is a general contractor. The contractor sees the plumber's work before it's covered up; you don't get that opportunity. In addition, your contractor understands the indicators of quality work that you may miss out on, like clean solder joints, crisp 90-degree angles at joints and clean, effectively sized holes in studs, floors, and joists. Finally, a quality contractor will not risk dealing with a substandard plumber. An easy error-- a joint left unsoldered or a leaky PVC line-- can easily devastate $10,000 worth of walls or wood floors and complicate the task with insurance claims, lost time, and lawsuits. With so much riding on the plumber, contractors tend to stick to only the very best.</p>

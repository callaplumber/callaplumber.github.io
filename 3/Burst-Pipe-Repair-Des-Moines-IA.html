<p>Aside from these two crucial parts, there are a myriad of small, maybe less important things that can break or deteriorate. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will wear away much more rapidly. Consistent gross smells coming from the toilet can show you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. You may need a new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising appropriately. Bulges in the supply line can trigger a leak and burst. Tank covers can break and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed if mishandled. While this won't affect the function of your toilet, it certainly doesn't do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by mentioning all the things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a total fixture and every part needs to be in great shape for it to operate at its best.</p>
<p>When per year to clean out the drains and keep everything running smoothly, we recommend that house owners invest in cleaning from a drain cleaning plumber at least.

If you have actually attempted to unclog a bathroom or kitchen sink without any luck, it might be time to call a professional plumber. They can identify the area of the blockage and the best ways to unclog the traffic jam without damaging your plumbing.</p>

<h3>Water Heater Repair Symptoms in Maynard MA 01754</h3>
<p>Backflow means the undesirable turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the potable supply of water; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from taking place. Points at which a potable water system gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, however they must be thoroughly developed and installed to avoid backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>
<p>While fighting a fire, firefighters are naturally more concerned about drawing sufficient water to splash the blaze than backflow prevention. Not only will they utilize water from any offered source to accomplish their objective, however fire department vehicles often carry non-potable water treated with antifreeze, rust inhibitors, or extinguishing agents.</p>

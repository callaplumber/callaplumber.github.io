<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the usual option is to have the faulty pipes replaced. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping comes in. This is a choice to think about if you live in an older home - such as one built pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular choice for home plumbing for many years, but steel eventually struggles with rust and lacks the sturdiness of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>

Flapper valves, fill valves, and other tank parts can all wear and trigger toilet leaks that aren't plainly noticeable to the naked eye. Toilet leaks around the base can also happen around the toilet gaskets (the bolts that seal the tank to the toilet bowl) or the wax ring below the base of the toilet.</p>
<p>Light Blue = Reduced Pressure Zone - supply pressure pushes open the # 1 check and is lowered by the # 1 Examine spring (for example, to 90 psi). This pressure difference across the # 1 check valve preserves the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone rises towards the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, avoiding backflow (reverse movement of fluid).</p>

<p>Remodeling plumbers normally charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one guy and a truck. Once again, this doesn't consist of the cost of parts. But increasingly more plumbers are charging "by the component," and their bids are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly spend a lot more. With this technique, you know the turnkey price entering into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's duty, not yours.</p>

Another threat in sewer repair tasks is the collapse of earth from the walls around the dig website. Your security and health are too crucial to risk in a Do It Yourself sewer project! Prevent these safety risks by hiring a professional plumber.</p>

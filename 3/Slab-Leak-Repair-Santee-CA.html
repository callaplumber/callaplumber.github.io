<p>Using different metals in the plumbing can cause galvanic rust Direct contact in between different metals will initiate the formation of a galvanic cell, which is created whenever two different types of metal are conductively connected to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is created since of the process. A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is straight connected to copper pipe. It is likewise worth keeping in mind that while using a brass fitting to bridge the space between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not entirely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to mitigate this direct contact between the different metals. A dielectric coupling includes an insulating material that physically separates contact in between the two metals.</p>

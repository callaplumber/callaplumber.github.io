<p>A clogged drain can cause a devastating leak in time. Do not wait till it's far too late! Trust our water leak detection solutions to fix your home's problems. Cooking Grease: Cooking grease need to never ever be tossed down the kitchen drain. While it may go down as a liquid, as it cools it can become strong, coating your pipes in the process.

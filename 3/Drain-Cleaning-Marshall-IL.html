<p>The pipe-bursting technique is utilized on pipes that are severely damaged, for changing a whole pipe system, or for fixing larger sections of sewer pipeline The installers need physical access to the pipe in order to begin repair, which includes 2 four foot square access pits at either end of the pipeline. The installers start by placing a "bursting head" at the gain access to point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is used to drag the head through the pipe. As it makes its way through the system, breaking the old pipe apart and drawing in a brand-new smooth pipe behind it. The pipe is a plastic product that will be invulnerable to root intrusion for approximately 100 years.</p>
<p>If your flapper valve has a ball that drifts at the end of a rod, gently lift the rod and listen. You might be able to stop the running by changing the float if the water shuts off. Some fill toilet valves have a float modification screw on top (see Figure A below). If there is no adjustment screw, bend the float arm. Make sure it's adjusted effectively (Picture 8)if you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve. You don't need to empty the tank to make these adjustments.</p>
<p>Serious problems can occur if your gas piping isn't secure. Unsecured propane or gas piping pipe can leak and it need to be fixed right away with gas pipe repair.

Such connections occur naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashers, however they should be thoroughly created and installed to avoid backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>

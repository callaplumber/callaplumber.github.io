<p>Inspect the house's hot water heater You will be looking to see if it is huge enough to accommodate your requirements (a household of 4 must have at least a 40 gallon tank), where it lies, and the water heater's age.

Mineral deposits can decide on the tank's bottom, leaving less room for water - which will imply that less water will be warmed and offered for use. Also, deterioration of the tank's aspects can cause the tank to have a short life. Demand that a new one be installed if the water heater is old or you see obvious indications of deterioration.</p>

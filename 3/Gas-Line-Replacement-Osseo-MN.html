    <meta name="description" content="Certified Plumbing Services Osseo Minnesota - Limestone dissolved in water is termed "hardness." Ground water dissolves limestone from deposits formed eons ago through the following steps: a) carbon dioxide reacts with water to produce carbonic acid which in the environment exists primarily as the bicarbonate ion (HCO3-1); b) microscopic marine organisms consume this as carbonate and form calcite skeletons which were deposited over millions of years to form limestone deposits which are found extensively in many parts of the world; c) ground water is often slightly to moderately acidic due to anaerobic decomposition and action of bacteria in the soil.">

<p>Backflow prevention assemblies are developed to offer decades of security. There are many regional conditions that can reduce the working life of a backflow preventer.  Conditions such as extreme pressure, water quality, turbidity or temperature level can all cause the assembly to degrade in its performance. Some backflow prevention assemblies might seldom need repair while some are repaired on a regular basis. The test information from the field test will identify the repair frequency.</p>

These accessories include backflow prevention system accessories, backflow device enclosures, test kits, repair parts, and insulated pouches.

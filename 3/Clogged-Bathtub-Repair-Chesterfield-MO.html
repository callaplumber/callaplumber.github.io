<p>The secret to avoiding a clogged garbage disposal is moderation. As long as the food waste is sent through the disposal at a sensible quantity, there should be no issue in getting most of the waste through. There are a few food products you need to most likely not put into the waste disposal unit though. Those items are coffee premises, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another tip to stop blocking is to keep an eye out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will harden when they cool so it is best to wash pots and pans that have those liquids under hot water and to continue to let the water run for a number of seconds after you are completed cleaning to ensure the drain is clear.</p>

<p>Deluge systems are designed so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems generally are installed in areas where the possibility of an extreme fire condition is likely, such as airplane hangars.

If a fire happens, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then enables water to discharge from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>

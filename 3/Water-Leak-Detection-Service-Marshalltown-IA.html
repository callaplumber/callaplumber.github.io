<p>Backflow suggests the unfavorable turnaround of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the potable supply of water; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from taking place. Points at which a potable water system gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they need to be thoroughly created and set up to prevent backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>

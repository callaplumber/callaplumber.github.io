<h3>Plumbing, Heating & Air Conditioning In Wexford PA</h3>
<p>These people were remarkable! They appeared early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been a problem on and off for several years now. It was set up 7 years earlier, and it never drained this well. I selected this company because they had fantastic evaluations and a reasonable cost, and although the task took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a huge, disgusting mess on their hands (literally), and they did a terrific job cleaning up after it too.</p>

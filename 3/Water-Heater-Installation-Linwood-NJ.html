<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable water system pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in potable water system pressure happen whenever the amount of water being utilized exceeds the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>

<p>One typical method for a house's supply of water to be polluted is if the irrigation water lines, which might end up being polluted by pesticides or weed poison, backflow into the interior water lines.

A backflow preventer not just protects drinking water in individual homes, it also prevents wastewater in private homes from receding out and infecting the public water system.</p>

<p>A total repipe of a house's water system, frequently done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most costly and intricate plumbing job, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company concentrating on entire home repiping. Current Review: Carlos and Lopez were incredible. My 90 years of age Daddy's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos got to 8am the next day to repair. Since of the age of the home and place of the pipe, it was a challenging task. They worked for nearly 12 hours into darkness to make certain the system was working before they left. I am truly grateful for their hard work and professionalism.</p>

Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is created because of the procedure. A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly linked to copper pipe. It is also worth noting that while using a brass fitting to bridge the space in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not entirely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to reduce this direct contact in between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling includes an insulating product that physically separates contact in between the 2 metals.</p>

<p>The salt water tank help the water softening system in regeneration. It is a much shorter tank that sits nearby to the mineral tank. The salt water tank holds an extremely focused service of salt (or often potassium) to restore the resin beads' favorable charge. Salt is manually contributed to the brine tank in the type of pellets or blocks. These liquify in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve signs up the softening capability of the resin is decreasing, the heavy brine solution is drawn out of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank.

If the area is considered a confined area, correct safety preventative measures must be followed for correct entry. A safe and correct work environment might entail the placement of safety barricades or entry restrictions around the work area so the repair professional or the public around your work area are not hurt. This could impact the service technician's ability to successfully finish the repair if the backflow preventer is installed in a restrictive area.</p>

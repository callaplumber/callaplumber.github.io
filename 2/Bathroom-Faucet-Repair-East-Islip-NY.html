<p>Backflow preventer installation requires the services of a licensed professional engineer (PE) or licensed registered architect (RA), and licensed master plumber (LMP).

Exemptions, which are approved in very uncommon cases where the building is considered to not position a risk to the supply of water, need to be submitted with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the property owner. If your structure has an existing backflow preventer, but the DEP has no record of its installation, you need to have a licensed professional file a record drawing of the device, along with an initial test report of the device for DEP review.</p>

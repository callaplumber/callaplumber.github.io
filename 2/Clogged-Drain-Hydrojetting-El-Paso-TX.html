<p>A total repipe of a home's water system, typically done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most intricate and pricey plumbing job, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company focusing on entire home repiping. Recent Evaluation: Carlos and Lopez were incredible. My 90 year old Father's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos came to 8am the next day to repair. Because of the age of the home and location of the pipe, it was a challenging job. They worked for almost 12 hours into darkness to make sure the system was working before they left. I am genuinely grateful for their hard work and professionalism.</p>

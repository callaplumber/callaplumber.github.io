<p>Your waste disposal unit ensures that your sink and plumbing fixtures don't get clogged. Contrary to some individuals's understanding, garbage disposals do not contain blades. Instead, a garbage disposal features two fixed bolts that are repaired to a spinning disk. When the disposal is switched on the disks rapidly spin, and these bolts force food and particles to grind versus a fixed mill along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action efficiently pulverizes the food waste in the disposal so that it can take a trip down the drain without clogging.</p>

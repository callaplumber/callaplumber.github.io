<p>Your old discharge tube most likely won't be the best length for your new disposal. If it's too long, just connect it to the disposal, mark it and cut it with a hacksaw for your waste disposal unit installation. (Loosen up the other pipe connections, if needed, to place the tube back into the tee.) If the old discharge tube is too short, you might need to make a time-wasting trip to the store. To prevent this, ensure the new garbage disposal installation package includes a tube, or purchase one separately at the exact same time for about $3.</p>

No water filter you purchase can definitively get rid of lead from your drinking water.</p>

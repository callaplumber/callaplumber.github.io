<p>A partial reroute is essentially a little scale repiping of several affected areas of the plumbing beneath the slab.

Costing less than a full repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can accumulate in cost extremely quickly. This is the main reason that we will recommend a full repipe in certain neighborhoods, based upon our experience.</p>
<p>There are two types of piping that are utilized in the repiping procedure. Copper piping and PEX piping are utilized because of their security, effectiveness and cost.

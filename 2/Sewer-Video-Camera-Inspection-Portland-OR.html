The threaded water system shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not included in this measurement.

<p>Downsides to be aware of is that hybrid hot water heater need to be installed in an area that stays between 40 to 90 degrees, or they will not work well. They need as much as 7 feet of clearance from the floor to ceiling, since the heatpump is on top of the hot water heater.

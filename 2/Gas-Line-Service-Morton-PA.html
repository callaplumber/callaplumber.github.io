<p>Figuring out if you need a water softener is a personal choice. Water softener systems work by getting rid of firmness minerals and replacing them with sodium ions. Water conditioners are devices that help avoid the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They utilize a physical media to prevent the scale from developing by neutralizing the solidity itself. Due to the fact that water conditioners utilize a physical media rather of a chemical media, they are sometimes thought about a greener alternative in areas where it is forbidden to use salt. Water conditioners do not efficiently eliminate solidity from the water supply, nevertheless, as the only method to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>

Costing less than a full repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can add up in cost very quickly.

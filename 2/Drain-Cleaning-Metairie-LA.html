<p>If your flapper valve has a ball that drifts at the end of a rod, carefully listen and raise the rod. You may be able to stop the running by changing the float if the water shuts off. Some fill toilet valves have a float change screw on top (see Figure A below). Bend the float arm if there is no change screw. Make sure it's adjusted properly (Photo 8)if you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve. You don't have to empty the tank to make these changes.</p>
<p>Keep in mind: Hard water stops your washing cleaning agent from working efficiently due to the fact that tough water ions can bond with detergent molecules to deactivate them. You, therefore, need to utilize more and more cleaning agent to accomplish the very same cleaning power. The media gets a bath in the salt option. Difficult minerals captured in the resin (or zeolite) are released and the media gets replenished with salt ions. The water softener is also cleaned up and sanitized throughout regrowth. Finally, water containing the difficult minerals and other waste gets flushed out of the system.</p>

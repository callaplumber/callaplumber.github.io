<p>When the hardware parts have been cleaned up and examined and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some parts may have really tight tolerances that need to be kept. An essential thing to recognize on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the element. The guide is an extremely critical part of the design of each component. If the element is not repaired properly, the guide could restrict the movement (rather than stable or direct) of the component, which could trigger the element to not work to its capabilities. Many times springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In most cases the guides are limiting the travel of the element triggering lower test results than what is needed.</p>

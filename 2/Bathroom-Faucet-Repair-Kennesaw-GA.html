For instance, backflow at unrestrained cross connections (cross-connections are any actual or possible connection in between the public supply of water and a source of contamination or pollution) can allow toxins or contaminants to get in the potable water system. Illness can arise from ingesting water that has been polluted due to backflow.</p>
<p>The next criteria to assess is how the backflow prevention assembly is installed. It is very important that the repair professional understands the appropriate installation orientation and can assess the installation conditions to ensure there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly should be set up in the installation orientation for which it was approved. The majority of backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, however it is very important that the assembly just be set up if it is authorized for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may trigger the backflow prevention assembly to not work properly and no matter the number of parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work due to the fact that the installation orientation is causing the failure.</p>

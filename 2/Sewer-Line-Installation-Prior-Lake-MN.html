<p>Replacing the old disposal with an identical brand-new one is less complicated than changing with a different model. So, if you are not looking particularly for a various disposal this may be something to think about. An entirely various disposal, or for installing your first disposal, the sink adapter has to be puttied into place. A safe and secure seal is a must.

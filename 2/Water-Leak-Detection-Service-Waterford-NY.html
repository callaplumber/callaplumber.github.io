<p>Identifying if you need a water softener is an individual preference. Water softener systems work by removing solidity minerals and replacing them with salt ions. Water conditioners are gadgets that help avoid the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They utilize a physical media to prevent the scale from building up by reducing the effects of the hardness itself. Due to the reality that water conditioners use a physical media rather of a chemical media, they are sometimes considered a greener option in areas where it is forbidden to use salt. Water conditioners do not successfully eliminate hardness from the water supply, however, as the only way to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>

<p>The trick to preventing a clogged waste disposal unit is small amounts. As long as the food waste is sent out through the disposal at a reasonable quantity, there need to be no problem in getting the majority of the waste through. There are a few food products you should probably not put into the garbage disposal though. Those products are coffee premises, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another tip to stop clogging is to keep an eye out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will solidify when they cool so it is best to wash pots and pans that have those liquids under hot water and to continue to let the water run for several seconds after you are completed cleaning to ensure the drain is clear.</p>

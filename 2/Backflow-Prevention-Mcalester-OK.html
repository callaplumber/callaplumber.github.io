<p>In some homes, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to technique when searching for a practical solution, particularly when simple plunging doesn't appear to work. However, there are many disadvantages to utilizing these hazardous items - not least of which is that they typically consist of substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is causing a blockage, which can range from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your residential or commercial property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, but at the cost of presenting the danger of damage to your home and family.</p>

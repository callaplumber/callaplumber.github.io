Which is why picking a comfy, well-crafted toilet seat is extremely essential. However, you need to make certain your toilet seat in fact fits your toilet. Most of toilets are basic sized - indicating a "will fit" seat is sufficient for safety and comfort. Some toilets, however, have uniquely formed bowls and require a specific seat, like the Eljer Emblem. It really isn't a great concept to use a toilet seat that is either much too huge or much to small, unless they have actually been specifically designed to fit normal toilets, as the toilet seat can wobble and cause you to slide around, or won't distribute your weight equally and might eventually trigger fractures in the bowl.</p>

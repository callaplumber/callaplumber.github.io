<p>Backflow suggests the undesirable turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the safe and clean water supply; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from taking place. Points at which a safe and clean water supply connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, but they must be carefully developed and installed to prevent backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>

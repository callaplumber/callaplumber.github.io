<p>Organic debris, such as hair, food, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the cause of clogged drains. The most typical method a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's drain, snake or cable television auger. The tool is carefully placed down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a newbie's Do It Yourself job. If you use the tool improperly, you can harm your pipes and cause other leakages - so it's worth it to call someone who understands the drill.</p>
<p>A clogged drain can make any of your plumbing fixtures unusable. Whether you have a sink that does not drain appropriately or a shower that holds water for too long, a Sears Handyman can help.

In some cases, a handyman might figure out that a replacement part is required (like a tailpiece, reducer, or PVC  trap) to make sure typical operation for your drain. Call a Sears Handyman representative today to discuss repair options.</p>

<h3>How Preemptive Drain Cleaning Can Benefit A Homeowner in Riverside CT 06878</h3>
<p>Backflow means the unfavorable reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the drinkable water supply; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from taking place. Points at which a drinkable water supply connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they should be thoroughly developed and set up to prevent backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>

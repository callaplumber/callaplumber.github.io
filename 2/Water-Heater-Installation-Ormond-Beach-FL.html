Blanc also built a much larger version of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It needed to be towed by a truck and included a 10 hp gasoline engine and 1000 feet of steel cable television. It was capable of cleaning large commercial and community sewer pipes.

It is important that the repair specialist knows the appropriate installation orientation and can assess the installation conditions to make sure there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly.

If this is what is occurring to your home, you need your drain cleaned before it results in more damage and even costlier repairs.</p>

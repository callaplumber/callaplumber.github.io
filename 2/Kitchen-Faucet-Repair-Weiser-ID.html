<p>Old, worn, or damaged plumbing pipes can cause considerable problems. Even small leaks can slowly moisten walls and floorings up until they end up being breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other irritants. Old galvanized iron pipes may end up being rusty and include rust to the supply of water. Gurgling noise from pipes. An unusual, gurgling sound originating from the toilet whenever you flush or from the bathtub drain after you took a bath is never an excellent indication. Chances are your sewer line is clogged, and a plunger might not suffice to resolve this issue. Call a plumber instantly.</p>

<p>Viking SupplyNet's substantial stock of backflow valves and associated devices includes leading items from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the public water system react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, triggering them to scale, flake, and become brittle. This leads to micro-fractures and decreases the standard structural stability of the system. The system becomes weak and might stop working without caution, causing damage to the building structure and personal property. Incorrect installation is also a common cause of polybutylene system failure, which can be almost difficult to discover.</p>

<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable supply of water pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in potable water supply pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being used exceeds the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
<p>Home water softeners, likewise called ion exchange units, are appliances that remove calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for sodium or potassium. Once the resin beads become loaded with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium solution gets rid of the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After travelling through the beads, the resulting chloride service becomes a waste stream that decreases the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>

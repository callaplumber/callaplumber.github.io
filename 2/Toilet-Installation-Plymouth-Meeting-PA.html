<p>Salt Water Valve - Controls water circulation in and out of salt tank. Features automated shut-off to prevent overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is almost certainly from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water material of LP or gas is very low. Rainwater which has not filtered through the earth is an extremely pure kind of water. When water evaporates it leaves liquified solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. Therefore when vaporized water ultimately falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
<p>When a flush valve triggers a toilet to run, a used flapper is usually the offender. But not always. First, take a look at the chain that raises the flapper. If there's excessive slack in the chain, it can tangle up and prevent the flapper from closing securely. A chain with too little slack can trigger trouble too. Picture 3 demonstrates how to set the slack perfect.</p>

Water conditioners are devices that assist avoid the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They utilize a physical media to hinder the scale from building up by neutralizing the firmness itself. Due to the fact that water conditioners use a physical media rather of a chemical media, they are in some cases considered a greener alternative in areas where it is prohibited to utilize salt. Water conditioners do not effectively remove firmness from the water supply, however, as the only method to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>

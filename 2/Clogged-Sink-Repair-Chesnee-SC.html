<p>Drain clogs in bathroom sinks can happen gradually from the buildup of hair, littles soap and fibers from towels that collects within pipes. As a clog becomes larger over time, it obstructs the pipe, stopping water from draining correctly. You can combat hard water in numerous methods, consisting of filtering it by distillation or reverse osmosis, adding a packaged chemical softener such as powdered borax or washing soda (sodium carbonate), or running it through a water softener.</p>
<p>You probably understand something about your drains: they take water from your showers, sinks, and bathtubs to a local water treatment facility. When drains are working effectively that's really all you need to know about them, but when something goes wrong, you need to have a much deeper understanding of what kinds of problems can take place in pipes and how to fix them without doing more damage. That's where a professional plumber comes in-- they have the expertise to identify an issue and the tools and knowledge to fix it.</p>
<p>Your garbage disposal ensures that your sink and plumbing fixtures don't get clogged. Contrary to some people's perception, garbage disposals do not include blades. Rather, a garbage disposal features 2 stationary bolts that are fixed to a spinning disk. When the disposal is turned on the disks quickly spin, and these bolts require food and particles to grind versus a stationary grinder along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action effectively crushes the food waste in the disposal so that it can travel down the drain without blocking.</p>

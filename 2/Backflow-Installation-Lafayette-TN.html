<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable water system pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can create increases in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in drinkable water system pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being utilized exceeds the amount of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>

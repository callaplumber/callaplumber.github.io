<p>A partial reroute is essentially a small scale repiping of several affected areas of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost efficient, it is possible to just desert the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, walls and attics. Costing less than a full repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can add up in cost really rapidly. This is the main reason we will advise a complete repipe in specific communities, based on our experience.</p>

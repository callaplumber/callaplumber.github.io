The most typical washers are often available in your home centers and hardware shops. Other designs can be difficult to discover.

<p>Loose flanges are generally the result of wood rot. The flange screws merely will not keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best solution depends upon the degree of the rot. Use an ear-type repair ring if the rot is just under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into company wood farther away from the flange. Before you install this type of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might need to cut off a couple of ears to make it deal with your toilet.

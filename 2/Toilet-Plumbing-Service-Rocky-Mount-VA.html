<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean water system pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable water system pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can create increases in downstream pressure; temperature level boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in drinkable water supply pressure happen whenever the amount of water being utilized surpasses the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>

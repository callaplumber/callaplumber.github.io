We'll check your sink area, suggest a brand and install it. If your existing disposal isn't working, let our plumbers have a look. Often a little fix can return it to working order.</p>
<p>You may be lured to bond or patch a leak shut or replace only a single section of pipe to save money. While this might work in the short term, keep in mind that the weakened pipe is made of the same product as other pipes in your home, suggesting that difficulty might be brewing elsewhere in your plumbing system. Repiping now will offer you peace of mind and avoid bigger leaks down the roadway.</p>

The brine tank holds a highly concentrated solution of salt (or sometimes potassium) to bring back the resin beads' positive charge. Salt is by hand contributed to the brine tank in the form of blocks or pellets. These liquify in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve registers the softening capacity of the resin is diminishing, the heavy brine service is extracted of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank. The water passing through the unit will no longer be softened if the salt water tank runs out of salt.</p>
<p>Organic particles, such as food, hair, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the cause of clogged drains.

You can attempt to do this yourself, however this isn't a newbie's Do It Yourself project. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leakages - so it deserves it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>

<p>A. Generally wax does not "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Likewise, ensure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undetected issue. Attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>

This generally adds anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the general cost of the waste disposal unit installation.</p>

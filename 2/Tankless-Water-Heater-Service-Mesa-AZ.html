<p>Waste Disposal Unit Installation Tired of False Guarantees? Water flows in the tank where tiny resin beads swap the calcium and magnesium in the water for the salt or potassium they're holding. The beads serve as a sponge, adsorbing the firmness minerals from your water. This procedure is described as ion exchange, and soft water is the outcome. When the resin beads have actually maxed out their ability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be recharged (a procedure called regrowth). During this process, the resin beads are cleaned with the highly concentrated saltwater solution (brine) from the tank (made from the salt you added to the tank). The salt water forces the calcium and magnesium ions to be released from the beads and replaced with sodium or potassium ions.</p>

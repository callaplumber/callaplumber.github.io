<p>Aside from these 2 important parts, there are a myriad of small, perhaps less critical things that can degrade or break. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will corrode far more rapidly. Consistent gross smells originating from the toilet can show you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising properly, you might need a new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can cause a leak and burst. Tank lids can split and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed if mishandled. While this won't affect the function of your toilet, it definitely doesn't do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by discussing all the important things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a total component and every part needs to be in great shape for it to work at its best.</p>

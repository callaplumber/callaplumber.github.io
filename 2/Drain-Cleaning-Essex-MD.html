<p>House water softeners, likewise called ion exchange systems, are appliances that remove calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for sodium or potassium.

<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. They changed my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always dripped in the previous if I shut down the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was rather reasonable. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was very delighted with their service.</p>

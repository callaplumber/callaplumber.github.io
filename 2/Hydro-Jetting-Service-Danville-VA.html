<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, effective, and an excellent guy. He told me exactly what to anticipate (cost, time, procedure) in advance and delivered as assured. I will certainly utilize Clog Dawg again. Installing a waste disposal unit takes 2 to 3 hours with an average per hour rate of $25 to $70. These costs remain in addition to the cost of the disposal system. If your plumber has a minimum callout cost that is higher than the labor cost for the work, the overall you pay may be higher.</p>

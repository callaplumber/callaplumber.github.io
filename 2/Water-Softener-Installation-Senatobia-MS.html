<p>If your pipe is failing; one is to repair the bad connection that is triggering a stoppage, with PVC you have a couple of choices. The other is to go ahead and replace the entire line. Definitely replace if the line is about 40 years old and is revealing indications of age throughout. These days, you can replace the pipe without a digging trench. Based on the condition of the line, it might be an appropriate option to do just that. However, if the offset worsens trenchless might no longer be an alternative.</p>

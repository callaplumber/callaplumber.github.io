When galvanized pipe is directly linked to copper pipe, a typical example of this is. It is likewise worth keeping in mind that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the space between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it likewise will not totally avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to mitigate this direct contact in between the different metals.

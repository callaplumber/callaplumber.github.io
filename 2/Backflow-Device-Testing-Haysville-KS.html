This innovation is more cost efficient and lasts longer than typical water softening items such as ion exchange or reverse osmosis," continued Dr. Govind.</p>
<p>Each component of the assembly must be tested to identify what is in need of repair. The field test might not always show you the seriousness of the failure or whether repair parts beyond the basic rubber repair set are necessary. There may be additional test treatments, beyond those developed in the tester certification program, that can supply data showing the severity of the failure that might assist in the diagnostic analysis of the backflow prevention assembly.</p>

<p>Backpressure backflow in a building results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the inbound safe and clean supply of water. Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature level boosts in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when negative or reduced pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, normally due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A typical kind of backflow preventer is the lowered pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>

The repair may be as basic as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he produces information on the workings of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's responsibility to know what the field test data suggests for that particular assembly.  When a qualified tester analyzes the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>

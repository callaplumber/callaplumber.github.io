Such connections take place naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they should be carefully designed and set up to prevent backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>

<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable water supply pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can develop increases in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in drinkable supply of water pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being used surpasses the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>

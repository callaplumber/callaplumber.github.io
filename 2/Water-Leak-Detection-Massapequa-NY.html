<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable water supply pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable water system pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can produce increases in downstream pressure; temperature level boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in potable water supply pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being used goes beyond the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water mains.</p>

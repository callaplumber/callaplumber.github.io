<p>A reduced pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is installed in high threat" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has two spring checks, however also has a 3rd check valve that is in fact a vent open up to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is utilized in high-risk situations is since if the very first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains.

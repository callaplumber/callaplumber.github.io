If, say, you need a brand-new burner package and the hot water heater is five years of ages, then it makes good sense for you to spend the $120 for the part, particularly if you can do the work yourself. The closer the appliance is to that 8 to 12-year limitation, the more skeptical the economics of a repair ends up being.

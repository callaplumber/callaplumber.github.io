The installers start by positioning a "bursting head" at the gain access to point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is utilized to drag the head through the pipe. As it makes its method through the system, breaking the old pipe apart and drawing in a new smooth pipe behind it. The pipe is a plastic material that will be resistant to root intrusion for as much as 100 years.</p>

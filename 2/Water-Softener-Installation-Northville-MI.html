<p>Aside from these two essential components, there are a myriad of small, maybe less crucial things that can deteriorate or break. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will rust much more rapidly. Continuous gross smells originating from the toilet can suggest you need a new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. You may need a brand-new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting properly. Bulges in the supply line can burst and cause a leak. If mishandled, tank lids can split and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed. While this won't impact the function of your toilet, it definitely does not do much for the visual of your bathroom.

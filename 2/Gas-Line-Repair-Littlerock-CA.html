<p>Sewer linings can assist to repair cracked pipes without needing to entirely replace your sewer lines or ruin the area around them. Everyday usage should not trigger a water softener to leak. Leaks can also happen if you bump into the softener and scramble it, pulling the fitting apart. To prevent this from taking place, install the system in a safe and steady  area. If you live in an earthquake-prone area of the nation, secure the softener so that if the foundation begins moving, the softener doesn't tip over and rip out the plumbing.

<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. They changed my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the previous if I turned off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into.

I was super pleased with their service.</p>

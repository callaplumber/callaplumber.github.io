<p>In some households, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to method when searching for a viable option, specifically when easy plunging does not seem to work. Nevertheless, there are many downsides to using these dangerous products - not least of which is that they usually contain substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is causing an obstruction, which can vary from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, small items, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them reliable, but at the cost of presenting the threat of damage to your house and family.</p>

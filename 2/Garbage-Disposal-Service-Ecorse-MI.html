<p>Irrigation backflow devices are developed for installation on safe and clean water lines to protect against both back-siphonage and back-pressure of polluted water into the drinkable water supply.

<p>When the hardware parts have been cleaned and inspected and the rubber parts have actually been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some elements may have really tight tolerances that need to be maintained. An important thing to recognize on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the motion or directs of the component. The guide is an extremely critical part of the design of each component. If the part is not repaired correctly, the guide might restrict the movement (instead of constant or direct) of the element, which could trigger the part to not work to its capabilities. Lot of times springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In many cases the guides are limiting the travel of the component triggering lower test outcomes than what is required.</p>

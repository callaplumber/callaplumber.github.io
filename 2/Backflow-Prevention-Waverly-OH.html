<p>It prevails for hot water heater to leak due to varying pressure, and the temperature level and pressure relief valve belongs to the unit for that precise reason. But while small drips should not be trigger for concern, house owners must watch on the hot water heater leakages. I had a great experience with Gotelli Plumbing when we needed a leak in a pipe repaired. Tom was professional and friendly.

<p>Sometimes, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as easy as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he generates information on the workings of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's duty to know what the field test information means for that specific assembly.  When a qualified tester interprets the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>

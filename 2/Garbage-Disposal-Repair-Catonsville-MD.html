<h3>Hour Emergency Plumbing Service Catonsville MD</h3>
<p>Another typical argument against the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't reverse through them, so the valves should prevent backflow.  The obvious problem with this is that if the backflow takes place at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A basic manually run valve should stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if completely closed, has excellent seals, and does not leak.  Nevertheless the majority of the automatic valves, such as the electrical solenoid valves utilized for irrigation systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and totally closed.</p>
<p>At any time the pressure on the home (downstream) side exceeds the pressure on the city side, the 2 redundant check valves close-- preventing any backflow. Nevertheless, while DCV systems are considered safe for a lot of fire security systems, they do have a defect: if both valves stop working or particles in the water line avoids them from closing totally, backflow can take place.</p>

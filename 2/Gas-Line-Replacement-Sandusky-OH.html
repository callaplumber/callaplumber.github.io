<p>Aside from these 2 crucial elements, there are a myriad of little, possibly less vital things that can break or degrade. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will rust far more rapidly. Constant gross smells coming from the toilet can suggest you need a new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising effectively, you might need a brand-new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can trigger a leak and burst. Tank lids can break and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed if mishandled. While this will not affect the function of your toilet, it definitely doesn't do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by pointing out all the important things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a total fixture and every part needs to be in great shape for it to operate at its best.</p>

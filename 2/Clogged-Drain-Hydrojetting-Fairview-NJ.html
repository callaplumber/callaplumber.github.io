<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable water system pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can develop increases in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in safe and clean water supply pressure take place whenever the amount of water being utilized exceeds the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water mains.</p>

<p>In water distribution systems, water is typically preserved at a considerable pressure to make it possible for water to stream from the tap, shower, or other component. Water pressure might fail or be decreased when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is unexpectedly high need on the water system (for example, when several fire hydrants are opened). Lowered pressure in the pipe might permit polluted water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>

<p>In the meantime, however, we recommend you first shot utilizing non-harsh and non-abrasive white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Merely put a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, include some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mix sit for a while. If that doesn't work, you can attempt a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner. Many of these cleaners contain focused levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be very hazardous if it is available in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. Please ensure to take the appropriate precautions if using among these products.</p>

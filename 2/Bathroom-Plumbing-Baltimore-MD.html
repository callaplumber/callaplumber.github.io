<p>Changing your sink is a step-by-step process. Measure, cut, and link the pipes. Prior to connecting any pipes to your water softener, measure and cut your pipes to fit. If you are utilizing copper pipes, solder on any nipples and fittings before linking the system to the bypass valve to avoid melting the plastic. Seal all threads with plumber's tape. Plastic tubing like PEX can also be utilized. Though it may require additional adapters, flexible tubing is far simpler to work with and can make use of push-to-connect fittings, saving you time and the trouble of soldering.</p>
<p>Backflow preventers are a relatively simple system, regardless of their significance.

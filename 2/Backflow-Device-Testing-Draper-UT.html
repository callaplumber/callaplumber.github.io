<h3>Residential Plumbing Services Draper UT</h3>
<p>These guys were fantastic! They appeared early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been a problem off and on for years now. It was installed 7 years ago, and it never drained this well. I selected this company due to the fact that they had terrific reviews and a reasonable price, and even though the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a huge, horrible mess on their hands (literally), and they did an excellent job cleaning up after it also.</p>

Trenchless pipe repair is a type of pipe repair that does not include any excavation. Trenchless pipe repair also known as trenchless pipe lining is a long lasting and excellent choice for your damaged pipes. The pipe lining procedure involves our team saturating a felt liner with an unique resin mix. It is pushed through your pipeline when the felt liner is totally filled. As the liner moves through your pipes, it coats the interior walls, sealing all imperfections and fractures. The liner is left to harden in place for several hours or 60 minutes if heat is used. When the process is total, the liner will be removed and your pipe will be examined one more time to ensure your new pipe is set within your existing one.</p>

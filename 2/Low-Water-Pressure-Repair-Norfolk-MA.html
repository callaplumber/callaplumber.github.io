Blanc likewise constructed a much larger variation of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It had to be pulled by a truck and featured a 10 hp gasoline engine and 1000 feet of steel cable television. It was capable of cleaning big industrial and local sewer pipes.

<p>Some makers claim that the electrical gadgets they produce can impact the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surface areas. Since these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like conventional water softeners do, one advantage claimed for the user is the elimination of the need to include salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant development promo have actually been claimed, such systems do not get rid of minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can just change the downstream effects that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of certain systems has revealed a decrease of calcium scale formation. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>

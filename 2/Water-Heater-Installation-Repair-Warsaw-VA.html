<p>Pipeline leak detection is utilized to figure out if and in some cases where a leak has taken place in systems which contain gases and liquids. Applications vary from softening in remote areas to resolving issues of reagent addition. Motor sizes for garbage disposal are given in horse power, or HP. These correspond directly to how much waste the system can handle, and suggested sizes are generally based upon the number of users remain in a household. If your existing disposal clogs often, is noisy, leaks or does not operate properly, it may be time for a replacement. Installations should just be performed by plumbers as the installation needs both plumbing and electrical connections.</p>
<p>The person who does the testing must be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this certification, and a plumbing license is not needed to obtain this accreditation. I've contacted a few plumbers, and the estimate for backflow testing ranged from $150 - $250, but I would expect the cost to be considerably less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>

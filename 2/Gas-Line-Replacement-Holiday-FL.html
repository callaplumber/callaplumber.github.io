<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. They changed my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always leaked in the previous if I turned off the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was rather affordable. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was extremely happy with their service.</p>

First, plans for each device to be installed must be drawn up by a RA or PE, and an application for approval sent to the DEP, which might use up to three weeks or more to authorize and process. Turned down strategies need to be revised and resubmitted to the DEP approval queue, which can include another several weeks to the timeline.</p>
<p>This may sound like a joke, however it's really major if you wish to really get the most out of your investment. Start by requesting a copy of the plumbing inspection checklist. If you're getting a rough-in or last inspection on a building job or remodel, you can do a little online research so you can make final adjustments before inspection day. Failing an examination can imply undesirable hold-ups in your task.</p>

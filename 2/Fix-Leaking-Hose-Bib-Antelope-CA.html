<p>The U-shaped pipe below kitchen and bathroom sinks is something that people expect to see however seldom stop to think about. The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you flip the switch, but it does not grind up food, this implies the flywheel is stuck.

And that's where the term firmness" came from ... it's tough to wash in.</p>

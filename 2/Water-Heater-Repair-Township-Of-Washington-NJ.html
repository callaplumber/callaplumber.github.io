<p>The source or place of a sewer problem determines who pays for repair. The City is responsible for the public right-of-way (curb to suppress), from one side of the street to another. The property owner is accountable for the area from the curb to the back of their home line. Easements (usually 10 feet wide) where main drains pass through private property are an exception to this guideline.</p>
<p>Before our professional specialists can start using their skills and experience, we first need to guarantee that the line is properly cleaned and gotten ready for our repair. Our repair procedures depend on having a clean, smooth pipeline, otherwise, imperfections triggered by waste buildup can prevent the liner from adhering to the walls correctly. We clean the sewer lines with hydro jetting, a service that permits a detailed cleaning by blasting streams of hot, pressurized water straight into the line. The special nozzle attached to the hose directs the water in all directions to permit the water to cover the whole diameter of the sewer line and supply a careful cleaning.</p>

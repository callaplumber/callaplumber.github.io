<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the incoming safe and clean water system. Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when unfavorable or lower pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, generally due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A typical kind of backflow preventer is the reduced pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>

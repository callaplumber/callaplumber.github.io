<p>Whether a water supply is identified "soft" or "tough" depends on the presence of 2 highly soluble minerals, calcium and magnesium. From a health viewpoint, these minerals have no negative effects and are, in fact, essential daily nutrients. It is minerals that give water the refreshing taste many individuals discover desirable. However, when calcium and magnesium penetrate water, they buildup on contact surfaces, potentially plug pipes and damage water heaters, and reduce the effectiveness of soaps and detergents. At this moment the water is said to be difficult.</p>

The plan needs to be drawn to scale or with dimensions suggested from walls and all neighboring things.</p>
<p>Colored water-- If your warm water appears rusty, this could be a sign that your water heater is rusting on the within and might start leaking quickly.

<p>Video cameras are one of the most valuable tools in the plumbing service. When looking for a brand-new flapper, your best alternative is to attempt and find the exact same flapper that initially featured your existing flush valve. The easiest way to do that is by searching for your toilet model and selecting the flapper advised for that design. If you do not know your model number, however, we do use a comprehensive choice of "will fit" flappers to assist you out.

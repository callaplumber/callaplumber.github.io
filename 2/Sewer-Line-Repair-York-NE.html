<p>Your garbage disposal ensures that your sink and plumbing components do not get clogged. Contrary to some people's understanding, garbage disposals do not contain blades.

When the disposal is turned on the disks quickly spin, and these bolts require food and particles to grind against a stationary grinder along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action effectively pulverizes the food waste in the disposal so that it can travel down the drain without blocking.</p>

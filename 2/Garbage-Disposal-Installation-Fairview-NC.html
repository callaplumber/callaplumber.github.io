<p>Sewer linings can assist to repair cracked pipes without needing to totally replace your sewer lines or destroy the area around them. Day to day usage must not trigger a water softener to leak. Leaks can also take place if you run into the softener and scramble it, pulling the fitting apart. To prevent this from happening, install the unit in a steady and safe place.

If your water softener is leaking during regeneration, you need to wait till after the cycle is finished and after that inspected the system for cracks or broken fittings. You should also check to ensure your drain line is never blocked up with debris. A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener during regrowth and flood your basement or garage.</p>

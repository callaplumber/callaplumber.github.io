<p>As soon as the hardware parts have been cleaned up and checked and the rubber parts have been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some elements might have extremely tight tolerances that need to be maintained. An essential thing to identify on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the motion or directs of the component. The guide is a really critical part of the style of each part. If the part is not repaired correctly, the guide might restrict the movement (rather than constant or direct) of the part, which could cause the part to not work to its capabilities.

<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in River Falls WI 54022?</h3>
<p>Backflow implies the unwanted turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the safe and clean water supply; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from taking place. Points at which a potable water supply connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they must be thoroughly developed and installed to prevent backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>

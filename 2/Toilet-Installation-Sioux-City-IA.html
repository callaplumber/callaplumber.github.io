The repair may be as basic as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he creates data on the functions of the assembly.

When an experienced tester interprets the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>

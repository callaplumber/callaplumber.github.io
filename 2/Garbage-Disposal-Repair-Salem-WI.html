<p>Home water softeners, likewise called ion exchange systems, are devices that remove calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for salt or potassium. When the resin beads become full of calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium solution eliminates the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After travelling through the beads, the resulting chloride solution ends up being a waste stream that goes down the drain and eventually into the environment.</p>
<p>Deluge systems are designed so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems normally are set up in areas where the possibility of a serious fire condition is likely, such as airplane hangars. Water to the system is held back by the deluge valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire takes place, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then enables water to discharge from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>

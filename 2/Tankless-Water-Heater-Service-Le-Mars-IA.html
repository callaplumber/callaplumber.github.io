<p>Backflow preventers are a reasonably simple system, regardless of their significance. Most of commercial use backflow prevention setups utilize a valve system that connects with the watering line within your organisation, where irrigation meets the main supply of water. From here, the preventer can monitor the movement of water within your system, and prevent any potential back-pressure and back-siphonage that may be triggered by malfunctioning plumbing devices.

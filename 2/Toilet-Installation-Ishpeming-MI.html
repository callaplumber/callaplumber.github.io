<p>Your old discharge tube probably won't be the right length for your brand-new disposal. If it's too long, simply connect it to the disposal, mark it and suffice with a hacksaw for your waste disposal unit installation. (Loosen the other pipe connections, if essential, to place the tube back into the tee.) If the old discharge tube is too short, you might need to make a time-wasting trip to the store. To avoid this, make sure the brand-new garbage disposal installation package includes a tube, or purchase one independently at the same time for about $3.</p>

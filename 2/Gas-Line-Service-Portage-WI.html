<h3>Looking For A Plumber In Portage WI</h3>
<p>Backflow preventer installation needs the services of a licensed professional engineer (PE) or licensed registered architect (RA), and licensed master plumber (LMP). A licensed professional can help you identify if your structure needs a backflow preventer or multiple devices, or if you receive an exemption. Exemptions, which are approved in incredibly unusual cases where the building is deemed to not posture a threat to the water supply, need to be submitted with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the homeowner. If your building has an existing backflow preventer, but the DEP has no record of its installation, you should have a licensed professional file a record drawing of the device, along with an initial test report of the device for DEP evaluation.</p>

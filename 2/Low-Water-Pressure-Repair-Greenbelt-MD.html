<p>Troubleshooting is an issue. As a sewer and drain cleaning company, I face situations, on a regular basis that require a company such as Serve Pro to precede me on the job.

I 'd love to post some pictures of this. Simply look on line. The issue does exist.</p>

The majority of fire sprinkler heads, other than sprinkler heads on a deluge system are kept closed by a heat-sensitive operating system. Typically, this operating system is either a fusible link or a glass bulb.  Despite the operating mechanism, just the sprinklers that are exposed to heat will open during a fire.</p>

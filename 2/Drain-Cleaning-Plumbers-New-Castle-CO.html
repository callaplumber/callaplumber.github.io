<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Determining if you need a water softener is a personal preference. Water softener systems work by eliminating firmness minerals and changing them with sodium ions. Water conditioners are gadgets that help prevent the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They utilize a physical media to hinder the scale from building up by neutralizing the solidity itself. Due to the fact that water conditioners use a physical media rather of a chemical media, they are sometimes thought about a greener option in locations where it is prohibited to utilize salt. Water conditioners do not successfully eliminate solidity from the water supply, however, as the only method to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>

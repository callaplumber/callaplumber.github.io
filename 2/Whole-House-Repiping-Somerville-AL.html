<p>Backflow is a potential problem in a water supply due to the fact that it can spread contaminated water back through a distribution system. For example, backflow at unrestrained cross connections (cross-connections are any possible or real connection in between the public supply of water and a source of contamination or contamination) can permit pollutants or pollutants to go into the potable water supply. Illness can arise from ingesting water that has been infected due to backflow.</p>
<p>Some makers claim that the electrical devices they produce can impact the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surface areas. Because these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like traditional water softeners do, one advantage claimed for the user is the elimination of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size decrease and plant development promotion have been claimed, such systems do not remove minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can just alter the downstream results that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of specific systems has revealed a reduction of calcium scale formation. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" however rather "water conditioning".</p>

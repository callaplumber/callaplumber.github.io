<p>Garbage Disposal Installation Tired of False Assures? Water flows in the tank where small resin beads swap the calcium and magnesium in the water for the salt or potassium they're holding. The beads serve as a sponge, adsorbing the firmness minerals from your water. This procedure is described as ion exchange, and soft water is the result.

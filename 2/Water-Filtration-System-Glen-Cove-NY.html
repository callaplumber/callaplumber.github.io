<p>To identify if your home is a poly home," begin with the exterior. Underground water mains are typically blue in color (they can likewise be gray or black). The pipe is usually 1/2 to 1-inch in diameter. Often, it goes into the home near the hot water heater. Your main turned off is attached to completion of the water main. Make sure you examine both ends of the pipe. We have actually discovered cases where the copper pipe enters the home and polybutylene is at the meter.</p>
<p>Anything that goes down returns up once again - This is the second most common indication that your drains are clogged. When you see that the water you send down returns up after a while, it indicates your drains are entirely blocked, and the water is searching for another way out.

It is essential that the repair professional knows the appropriate installation orientation and can evaluate the installation conditions to make sure there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly must be installed in the installation orientation for which it was authorized. A lot of backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, however it is essential that the assembly just be installed if it is authorized for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may trigger the backflow prevention assembly to not work correctly and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work due to the fact that the installation orientation is causing the failure.</p>

<p>The source or place of a sewer problem identifies who pays for repair. The City is accountable for the public right-of-way (curb to suppress), from one side of the street to another. The property owner is responsible for the area from the curb to the back of their residential or commercial property line. Easements (usually 10 feet large) where main sewage systems traverse private property are an exception to this guideline.</p>
<p>Clear the trap: If the above techniques do not work, the next step would be to eliminate the P-trap under the sink. Place a pail below the area to catch water then loosen the 2 threaded caps that hold the curved area of the pipe in location. Nowadays, the majority of kitchen drains are made from white PVC pipe with connections that can be unscrewed by hand.</p>

<h3>Pressure Vacuum Breakers in Pittsfield Massachusetts</h2>
<p>In 1939, after his Roto-Rooter sewer cleaning machine proved effective, Sam Blanc created and developed a smaller design that operated on the same principle but might clean and clear bathroom and kitchen sink drains along with laundry drains and other household plumbing drains. Blanc also built a much bigger variation of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It needed to be hauled by a truck and featured a 10 hp gas engine and 1000 feet of steel cable television. It was capable of cleaning big commercial and community sewer pipes. An enhanced version called "The Mainliner" was presented in 1958 that might also thread telephone cable. It was stopped in 1973.</p>

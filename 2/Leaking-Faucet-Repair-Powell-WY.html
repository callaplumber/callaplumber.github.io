<p>Clogged toilets are one of the most common plumbing problems plumbers deal with, and for many individuals, it's an emergency when the toilet is all set to overflow. You can try to fix the clog yourself by utilizing a plunger, which you can buy at your local hardware shop. The only purpose of salt in a water softener is to regrow the resin beads that take the firmness out of water.</p>
<p>Carefully listen and raise the rod if your flapper valve has a ball that floats at the end of a rod. If the water turns off, you may have the ability to stop the running by adjusting the float. Some fill toilet valves have a float change screw on top (see Figure A below). If there is no adjustment screw, flex the float arm. If you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve, ensure it's adjusted properly (Photo 8). You do not have to clear the tank to make these adjustments.</p>

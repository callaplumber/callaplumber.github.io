<p>Whether changing an old one or putting one in for the very first time, there are a couple of things worth learning about garbage disposal installation.

<p>Don't put whatever down your garbage disposal. It is essential to see what you put down your garbage disposal. Foods like rice and pasta can swell when combined with water, and possibly cause a clog. Vegetables and fruit peels can likewise trigger blockages and jams - consider composting or putting these products in the garbage.

<p>A guideline is that you can regain the cost of the repair if the problems occurs well outside that 8 to 12 year life expectancy. If, say, you need a brand-new burner set and the hot water heater is 5 years old, then it makes sense for you to spend the $120 for the part, especially if you can do the work yourself. The closer the home appliance is to that 8 to 12-year limitation, the more skeptical the economics of a repair becomes. The factor is that some other part on the home appliance will go or its tank will leak. And there's no remedy for a leaking tank.</p>

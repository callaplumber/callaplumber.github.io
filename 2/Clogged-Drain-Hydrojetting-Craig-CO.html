<p>The very best way to handle high city water pressure according to the city of San Diego public utilities website is by setting up a pressure decreasing valve (PRV).

According to San Diego public utilities, a PRV can also assist to save water as fixtures in the house will utilize less water when the pressure is at a lower and more manageable PSI.</p>
<p>Galvanized metal, is just a simpler way of saying zinc coated" and what causes galvanized pipes to wear away is the direct exposure to excessive water and minerals. You may be believing that it doesn't make good sense to utilize a pipe that responds with water as your house's main source of water transportation, and you would be appropriate. Nevertheless, when the majority of these pipes were being installed, nobody understood this was going to be the outcome. Luckily, there are a lot of other piping alternatives nowadays including copper.</p>
<p>Wet pipe systems are set up in locations where the ambient temperature level is preserved at or above 40 Â° F. When a sprinkler is triggered by heat from a fire, water flows instantly from the sprinkler head. These systems have water in the pipe at all times. In situations where there is a need to provide sprinklers in an unheated area, such as a small loading dock, an antifreeze system can be used. The addition of this chemical additive will require the installation of a high threat defense assembly.</p>

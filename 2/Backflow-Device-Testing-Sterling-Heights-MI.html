<p>If the problems happens well outside that 8 to 12 year life expectancy, a guideline of thumb is that you can recapture the cost of the repair. If, say, you need a brand-new burner set and the water heater is 5 years old, then it makes sense for you to spend the $120 for the part, especially if you can do the work yourself. The closer the device is to that 8 to 12-year limit, the more doubtful the economics of a repair ends up being. The factor is that some other part on the home appliance will go or its tank will leak. And there's no remedy for a leaking tank.</p>

An easy mistake-- a joint left unsoldered or a leaky PVC line-- can quickly ravage $10,000 worth of walls or hardwood floors and make complex the job with insurance claims, lost time, and suits. With a lot riding on the plumber, contractors tend to stick to just the very best.</p>

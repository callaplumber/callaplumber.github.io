<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumbing Services Marietta PA</h3>
<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable supply of water pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can produce increases in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in drinkable water supply pressure occur whenever the amount of water being utilized goes beyond the quantity of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>

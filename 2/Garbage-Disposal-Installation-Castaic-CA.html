<p>Wet pipe systems are installed in areas where the ambient temperature is kept at or above 40 Â° F. When a sprinkler is activated by heat from a fire, water flows instantly from the sprinkler head. These systems have water in the pipe at all times. In circumstances where there is a need to provide sprinklers in an unheated area, such as a little loading dock, an antifreeze system can be utilized. The addition of this chemical additive will require the installation of a high hazard protection assembly.</p>

<h3>Plumbing, Heating & Air Conditioning In Castaic CA</h3>
<p>In water circulation systems, water is usually preserved at a substantial pressure to allow water to flow from the tap, shower, or other component. Water pressure might be or stop working decreased when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is suddenly high demand on the water system (for example, when a number of fire hydrants are opened). Minimized pressure in the pipe might allow polluted water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be prepared into the system.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a process in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at up to 3,500 PSI. This permits the sewer lines to be cleaned quickly and effectively with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, discharging from the forward and reverse jets in the nozzle, move the hose through the line to get rid of debris such as hard water scale, sand, grease, and silt deposits.</p>

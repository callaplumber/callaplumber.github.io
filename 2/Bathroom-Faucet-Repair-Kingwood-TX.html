<p>I can't state enough advantages about this company. Had a sewer repair needed and had an extremely short quantity of time due to closing on a house sale.

<p>Improvement plumbers usually charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one man and a truck. Once again, this does not consist of the cost of parts. But increasingly more plumbers are charging "by the component," and their bids are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily invest far more. With this technique, you know the turnkey price entering into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's obligation, not yours.</p>

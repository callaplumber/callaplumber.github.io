<p>Water softening utilizes a procedure called "ion exchange" to get rid of liquified hard water minerals such as calcium, magnesium, manganese and iron. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular response is needed. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto sodium, and as the hard water flows through the resin, the salt is switched for the hard water minerals. The hard water minerals are caught in the softener and a trace amount of sodium drains with the softened water.</p>

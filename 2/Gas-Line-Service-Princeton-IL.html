<p>The trick to preventing a clogged waste disposal unit is moderation. As long as the food waste is sent out through the disposal at an affordable amount, there need to be no concern in getting the majority of the waste through. There are a couple of food items you must most likely not take into the garbage disposal though. Those products are coffee premises, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another suggestion to stop clogging is to keep an eye out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will solidify when they cool so it is best to clean pots and pans that have those liquids under warm water and to continue to let the water run for a number of seconds after you are completed cleaning to make sure the drain is clear.</p>

While some older houses might not have backflow preventers, all more recent properties are required to have them. If you're not exactly sure what sort of backflow preventers are utilized in your home or business, Doug's can help you find and recognize them. We can likewise perform your yearly backflow inspections.</p>
<p>The next requirements to examine is how the backflow prevention assembly is set up. It is very important that the repair professional understands the proper installation orientation and can assess the installation conditions to guarantee there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly must be installed in the installation orientation for which it was authorized. Most backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, however it is necessary that the assembly only be installed if it is authorized for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation might trigger the backflow prevention assembly to not work appropriately and no matter the number of parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work because the installation orientation is causing the failure.</p>

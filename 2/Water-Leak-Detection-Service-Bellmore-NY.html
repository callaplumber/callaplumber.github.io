<p>The pipe-bursting technique is used on pipes that are seriously harmed, for changing an entire pipe system, or for repairing larger sections of sewer pipeline The installers need physical access to the pipe in order to begin repair, that includes two four foot square access pits at either end of the pipeline. The installers start by putting a "bursting head" at the gain access to point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is utilized to drag the head through the pipe. As it makes its way through the system, breaking the old pipe apart and drawing in a brand-new smooth pipe behind it. The pipe is a plastic material that will be resistant to root invasion for up to 100 years.</p>

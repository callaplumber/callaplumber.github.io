<p>A partial reroute is basically a small scale repiping of one or more affected locations of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost reliable, it is possible to just abandon the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, ceilings and walls. Costing less than a full repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can add up in cost very rapidly. This is the main reason why we will advise a complete repipe in specific areas, based upon our experience.</p>

<p>A decreased pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is installed in high risk" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has 2 spring checks, but likewise has a third check valve that is really a vent open up to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is utilized in high-risk circumstances is due to the fact that if the first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains. This relief valve uses an additional layer of defense compared to the DC, which will enable backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the reason that when you test an RPZ, you force water to backflow to ensure the RPZ discharges.</p>

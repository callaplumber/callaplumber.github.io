Oxidants such as chlorine in the public water system respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, triggering them to scale, flake, and become brittle. This leads to micro-fractures and reduces the basic structural stability of the system. The system ends up being weak and may fail without warning, causing damage to the building structure and personal property. Improper installation is also a typical reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly impossible to spot.</p>

<p>Garbage Disposal Installation Tired of False Promises? Water distributes in the tank where tiny resin beads switch the calcium and magnesium in the water for the salt or potassium they're holding.

During this procedure, the resin beads are cleaned with the extremely focused saltwater solution (brine) from the tank (made from the salt you added to the tank). The brine forces the calcium and magnesium ions to be released from the beads and replaced with sodium or potassium ions.</p>

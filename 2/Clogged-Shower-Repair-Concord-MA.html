Copper is standard due to the fact that it's long-lasting, can make it through fires, and withstands weather. However, copper is tough to install, which implies higher labor expenses.

<p>The mineral tank is the chamber where the difficult water is softened. The water system line feeds the tough water into the tank. The water seeps through the bed of resin beads, depositing the water-hardening calcium and magnesium ions. The water exits the tank soft and flows through your pipes and out to your household appliances.

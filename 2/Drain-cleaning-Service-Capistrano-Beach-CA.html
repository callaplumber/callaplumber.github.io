Once again, the very best kind of backflow prevention is an air gap, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would flow over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to make sure there is an air gap, if there is no other way to offer one, then we examine to see that the appropriate BFP device is set up. These BFP's, if testable, are needed to be checked (by a certified backflow preventer tester) upon installation and a minimum of every twelve months afterwards.</p>

Once again, the very best kind of backflow prevention is an air gap, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would flow over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to ensure there is an air space, if there is no chance to provide one, then we check to see that the correct BFP device is installed.

The unit selected for a given installation needs to be appropriate for the system design and site conditions, consisting of factor to consider of whether back siphoning or backpressure is likely to take place.

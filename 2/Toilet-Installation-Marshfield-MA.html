<p>When utilized in combating a fire, fire department connections can be a concern. Firefighters by and large are not worried about backflow prevention issues. They are concerning with securing people's lives and to a lower extent their residential or commercial property. Getting the required volume of water on a fire is their mission and they will use water from any source readily available to attain that goal. This can develop cross-connection control problems and may as a result indicate that the level of defense on the fire security system may need to be increased to a high danger security level.</p>

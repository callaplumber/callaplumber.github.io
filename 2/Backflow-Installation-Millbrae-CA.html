<p>One typical method for a house's water system to be polluted is if the watering water lines, which might become tainted by pesticides or weed toxin, backflow into the interior water lines. If that contaminated water were to backflow into the community drinking supply, the issue might spread out greatly. A backflow preventer not just protects drinking water in private homes, it also avoids wastewater in personal homes from receding out and contaminating the public water system.</p>
<p>A number of companies, such as the American Water Works Association (AWWA) and the American Backflow Prevention Association (ABPA) provide certification courses designed to train professionals to test backflow preventers. Requirements for training vary by jurisdiction. Inspection of backflow preventers requires knowledge of installation requirements, although inspectors are not needed to become certified.</p>

<p>In 1939, after his Roto-Rooter sewer cleaning machine proved successful, Sam Blanc designed and built a smaller design that operated on the same principle but could clean and clear bathroom and kitchen sink drains along with laundry drains and other household plumbing drains. Blanc also constructed a much larger version of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It had to be hauled by a truck and included a 10 hp gas engine and 1000 feet of steel cable television. It was capable of cleaning large industrial and municipal sewer pipes. An improved version called "The Mainliner" was introduced in 1958 that could also thread telephone cable television. It was terminated in 1973.</p>

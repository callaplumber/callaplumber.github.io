Changing galvanized pipes in older houses is important since of the way galvanized pipes tend to deteriorate throughout the years. Galvanized pipe is made by finishing steel pipe with zinc. As time carry on, the zinc wears down, exposing the steel.</p>
<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. They changed my kitchen faucet and included 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly leaked in the previous if I turned off the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was quite sensible. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was very happy with their service.</p>

The closer the appliance is to that 8 to 12-year limitation, the more doubtful the economics of a repair ends up being. The factor is that some other part on the device will go or its tank will leak. And there's no treatment for a leaking tank.</p>

<p>Often, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as simple as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he produces data on the workings of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's responsibility to understand what the field test information means for that specific assembly.  When a trained tester translates the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>

<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. They changed my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the previous if I shut down the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was rather reasonable. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was super pleased with their service.</p>

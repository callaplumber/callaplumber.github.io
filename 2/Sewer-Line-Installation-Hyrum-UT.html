<p>The mineral tank is the chamber where the difficult water is softened. The water supply line feeds the tough water into the tank. The water seeps through the bed of resin beads, depositing the water-hardening calcium and magnesium ions. The water exits the tank soft and flows through your pipes and out to your household appliances. Backflow is a term used in the plumbing world to explain an unwanted flow of water in the reverse direction. The backflow of water brings pollutants back to the primary water supply system, making the water in it risky to drink.</p>

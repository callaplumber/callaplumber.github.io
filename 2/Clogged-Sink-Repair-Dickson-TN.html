The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to make sure there is an air gap, if there is no other way to offer one, then we check to see that the correct BFP device is set up. These BFP's, if testable, are needed to be evaluated (by a certified backflow preventer tester) upon installation and at least every twelve months thereafter.</p>

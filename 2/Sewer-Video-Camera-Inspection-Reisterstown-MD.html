<p>Carbon monoxide gas is launched when gas burns incompletely. The symptoms are the same as direct exposure to gas leak. The direct exposure to carbon monoxide is so fatal that anyone who inhales it requires immediate medical attention.

<p>All piping under sinks and faucets are looked for leakages or damage. How to inform if you have polybutylene pipes: If your pipes are white plastic and consist of the letters PB" in the printed label, you have polybutylene pipes and we suggest having them changed right away.

<p>Improvement plumbers normally charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one man and a truck. Again, this doesn't include the cost of parts. But increasingly more plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their quotes are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily invest a lot more. With this approach, you know the turnkey cost going into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's obligation, not yours.</p>

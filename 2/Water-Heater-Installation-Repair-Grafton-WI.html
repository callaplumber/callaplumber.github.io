<p>The backflow preventer is a device that avoids pollutants or impurities from being drawn into the drinking water system.

<p>In some homes, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to approach when searching for a practical option, particularly when basic plunging doesn't seem to work. However, there are many disadvantages to using these hazardous items - not least of which is that they typically include compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is causing a clog, which can range from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, small objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your residential or commercial property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, however at the cost of presenting the danger of harm to your house and household.</p>

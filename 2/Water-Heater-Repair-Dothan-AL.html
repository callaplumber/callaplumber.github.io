Dripping water is often caused by problems in the pressure-relief valve. If there are leakages originating from the hot water tank, opportunities are the storage is already rusted.

<p>The individual who does the testing must be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this accreditation, and a plumbing license is not needed to acquire this certification. I have actually talked to a few plumbers, and the estimate for backflow testing varied from $150 - $250, however I would expect the rate to be substantially less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>

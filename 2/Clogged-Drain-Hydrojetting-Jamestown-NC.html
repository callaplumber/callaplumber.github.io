<p>After professional drain cleaning, there are a few things you can do to keep your drains clear. Prevent putting grease or oil down the drains. Use a solution of baking soda and vinegar occasionally to keep your drains and waste disposal unit clean. You can utilize an organic drain cleaner regular monthly to keep your drains clear. We advise organic products, such as Bio-Clean, because they work much better than items containing severe chemicals and won't cause damage to your drains or fixtures.</p>
<p>Defective thermostat: Electric water heaters include a thermostat, which can restrict your hot water supply if broken. If a repair or replacement is the much better solution for you, we'll figure out what's incorrect with your thermostat and identify.

<p>Sewer problems are the last thing homeowner wish to get their hands filthy with. It requires more than just effort to fix broken sewer systems, and the problem is often due to how problematic it is to examine the damage.

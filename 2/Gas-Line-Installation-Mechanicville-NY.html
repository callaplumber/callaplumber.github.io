These systems generally are set up in locations where the possibility of a severe fire condition is likely, such as aircraft garages. Water to the system is kept back by the deluge valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire happens, the detection system sends a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then enables water to discharge from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>

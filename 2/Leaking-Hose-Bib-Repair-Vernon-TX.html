<p>A second part of the Battelle Study compared detergent dosage, water solidity, and washing temperature level to see if firmness had an influence on cleaning agent cost savings. The research study included tests that got rid of difficult soils, in addition to assessing identifying and shooting. Researchers discovered that softened water utilizes almost 30% less detergent, but cleans along with water at 10 gpg hardness level. When comparing soft water with water at a 25 gpg level, that cleaning agent cost savings increases to almost 70%.</p>
<p>I can't say enough good things about this company. Had a sewer repair needed and had an extremely short amount of time due to closing on a house sale.

Friendly, interacted well, absolutely responsive and truly cared to assist me through this extremely stressful task. All of individuals I encountered were role models for what a well run service organisation need to be. Much thanks and appreciation. You're great.</p>

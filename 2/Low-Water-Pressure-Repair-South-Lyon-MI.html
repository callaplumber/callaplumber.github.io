<p>When the drinkable supply piping is connected to a system or component which goes beyond the operating pressure of the supply piping, backpressure may take place.

If these connections are not effectively safeguarded, non-potable and drinkable water or liquids can be forced into the drinkable supply system.</p>
<p>A. Usually wax doesn't "spoil" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Also, make certain the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undetected issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>

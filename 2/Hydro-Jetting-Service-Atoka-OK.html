<p>A lowered pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is set up in high threat" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has 2 spring checks, but also has a third check valve that is really a vent open up to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is used in high-risk scenarios is since if the very first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve offers an extra layer of security compared to the DC, which will allow backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the factor that when you test an RPZ, you force water to backflow to make sure the RPZ discharges.</p>

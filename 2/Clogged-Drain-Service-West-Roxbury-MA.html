<p>Any location water goes through house. This consists of sinks, toilets, tubs, lines, and pipes. At this time, the pro will search for leakages and broken pipes or fittings. With toilets, the pro will inspect water levels, flappers, and filler mechanisms. She or he will eyeball noticeable pipes, and might run a camera inspection to inspect the pipes' condition from the within.</p>
<p>A. Normally wax does not "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Also, ensure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undiscovered problem. Try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>You live in an older house. If your house is 50 years old or older and you have actually never replaced its pipes, there's a likelihood that you'll need to have it done quickly.

If so, you might need to include a grounded outlet to power the garbage disposal if you do not currently have one. This usually includes anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the total cost of the garbage disposal installation.</p>

<p>Echologics has a long history of establishing award-winning acoustic innovations for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a video camera through the household sewer pipes (normally from your house to its connection to the general public sewer system) can be utilized to assess the type and condition of underground pipes, and to recognize problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, obstructions, rust or collapsed pipes. Homeowners may have a video inspection done to find the cause of routine sewer backups or other ongoing problems, or when offering or purchasing an older home.</p>

<p>The next criteria to assess is how the backflow prevention assembly is installed. It is very important that the repair professional knows the proper installation orientation and can assess the installation conditions to guarantee there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly need to be set up in the installation orientation for which it was approved. The majority of backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, however it is essential that the assembly only be installed if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may trigger the backflow prevention assembly to not work effectively and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work due to the fact that the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>
<p>Water softeners will go to drain throughout backwash and quick rinse anywhere from 2 to 4 GPM (depending on the size of the system). Each cycle will discharge 25 to 50 gallons of water with high levels of hardness minerals and chloride that you might not want just running outside. Not to mention plumbing code may be broken without proper backflow prevention.</p>

The installers begin by putting a "bursting head" at the gain access to point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is utilized to drag the head through the pipe. As it makes its way through the system, breaking the old pipe apart and attracting a brand-new seamless pipe behind it. The pipe is a plastic material that will be resistant to root invasion for as much as 100 years.</p>

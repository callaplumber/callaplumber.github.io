<p>Is your present kitchen sink dated? Do you wish to redo your kitchen with a more modern appearance or more practical purpose? Perhaps there is a fracture in the sink's basin and you've noticed a small leak. In any of these cases, it's best to have plumbing specialists replace your sink so you know you're getting the highest quality work.</p>

Salt won't trigger lime scale or soap residue buildup like other minerals do, and water softening adds only a very percentage of sodium to your water.

<p>A total repipe of a house's water system, frequently done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most costly and complex plumbing task, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company specializing in whole home repiping.

Just 4" of water pressure can be enough to obstruct a gas line. Sound-- With time sediment can build up in the bottom of your tank. This sediment eventually gets hard and eliminates from the capability of your hot water heater. This solidified sediment is most likely the source of the sound.</p>

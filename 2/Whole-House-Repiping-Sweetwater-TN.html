<p>Replacing your sink is a detailed procedure. Measure, cut, and connect the pipes. Before connecting any pipes to your water softener, procedure and cut your pipes to fit. If you are utilizing copper pipes, solder on any nipples and fittings prior to linking the unit to the bypass valve to avoid melting the plastic. Seal all threads with plumber's tape. Plastic tubing like PEX can also be utilized. Though it may need additional adapters, versatile tubing is far easier to work with and can utilize push-to-connect fittings, conserving you time and the hassle of soldering.</p>

Repiping now will give you peace of mind and prevent bigger leakages down the road.</p>

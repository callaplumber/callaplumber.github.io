The threaded water system shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not included in this measurement. The addition of a backflow preventer reduces water service pressure to the building; additional, more substantial expenses can occur if the drop in water pressure ends up being an issue for citizens. If installing a pump or larger size water service and backflow prevention device would counteract the pressure loss, a PE or RA can help figure out.</p>

<p>A partial reroute is basically a little scale repiping of one or more afflicted areas of the plumbing underneath the slab.

Costing less than a full repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can add up in cost extremely rapidly. This is the main reason why we will suggest a full repipe in particular communities, based upon our experience.</p>

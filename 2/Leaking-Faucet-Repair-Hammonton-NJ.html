<p>Often, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as simple as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he creates information on the workings of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's responsibility to know what the field test data means for that particular assembly.  When an experienced tester interprets the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>

<h3>Quality Plumbing Services In Westwood NJ</h3>
<p>Backflow preventer installation needs the services of a licensed professional engineer (PE) or licensed registered designer (RA), and licensed master plumber (LMP). A licensed professional can help you figure out if your structure needs a backflow preventer or several devices, or if you get approved for an exemption. Exemptions, which are approved in extremely uncommon cases where the structure is deemed to not position a threat to the water supply, must be submitted with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the property owner. If your building has an existing backflow preventer, but the DEP has no record of its installation, you should have a licensed professional file a record illustration of the device, along with a preliminary test report of the device for DEP evaluation.</p>

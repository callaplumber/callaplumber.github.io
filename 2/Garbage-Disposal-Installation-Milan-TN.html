This is so that it can bring in the irons that would usually trigger rust. After extended use, these rods will ultimately end up being broken and need to be changed.

<p>You reside in an older house. There's an excellent chance that you'll need to have it done quickly if your home is 50 years old or older and you've never changed its pipes. Galvanized pipes were usually set up in homes of this age, and these types of pipes are understood to rust and burst when they get old. If so, you might need to include a grounded outlet to power the garbage disposal if you do not currently have one. This usually adds anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the total cost of the garbage disposal installation.</p>

<p>Drain clogs in bathroom sinks can take place gradually from the accumulation of hair, little bits of soap and fibers from towels that collects within pipes. As a clog becomes bigger in time, it obstructs the pipe, stopping water from draining properly. You can combat hard water in numerous ways, including filtering it by distillation or reverse osmosis, adding a packaged chemical softener such as powdered borax or washing soda (sodium carbonate), or running it through a water softener.</p>
<p>Typically triggered by slow seepage from the tank into the bowl. Put a few drops of food coloring in the tank. Wait an hour, then inspect and see if you see coloring in the bowl. This shows a leaky flapper valve. Replacement is typically the fix. Additionally, in some cases a malfunctioning fill valve might actuate periodically, too. Water will not drain or is draining pipes slowly through the disposal.</p>
<p>Mechanical water softening units are for that reason likewise called ion exchange water softeners.

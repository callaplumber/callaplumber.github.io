<p>A total repipe of a home's water supply, typically done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most costly and complex plumbing task, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company specializing in entire house repiping. For an outdoor gas light or device whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can cause an obstruction or can cause corrosion that blocks the line. Just 4" of water pressure can be enough to obstruct a gas line. Sound-- With time sediment can develop in the bottom of your tank.

<p>Test for water tightness by plugging the drain with the stopper and filling the sink with an inch of water. Check for leaks under the sink to confirm that your plumber's putty is making a good seal. Get rid of the drain stopper, and enable the drain and P-trap to fill with water. Look for leaks and tighten up as necessary. Plug unit into a GFCI-protected receptacle, and arrange cables as preferred.</p>

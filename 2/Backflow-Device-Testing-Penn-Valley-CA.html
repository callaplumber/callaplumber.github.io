<p>Manual leak detection for drainage applications is the simplest of the three available approaches. Tankless units last 5-10 years longer than tanked units and require fewer repairs in time.

During regrowth, salty water from the brine tank flows up the fill tube and into the softener tank. A rinse cycle commences and the salty water cleans the mineral deposits off the resin beads. The regenerated water and the mineral deposits are flushed out the discharge hose. The system then reverts back to softening the inbound water.</p>

Most of commercial use backflow prevention setups use a valve system that gets in touch with the watering line within your business, where watering fulfills the main water system. From here, the preventer can monitor the movement of water within your system, and prevent any possible back-pressure and back-siphonage that may be caused by malfunctioning plumbing equipment.

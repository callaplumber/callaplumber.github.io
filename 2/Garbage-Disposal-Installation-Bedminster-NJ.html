Chicago Gas Lines focuses on natural gas installation and repair for fireplaces, fire pits, grills, devices, heaters, generators & gas lights. When no other source of a leak can be figured out, it is safe to presume that it is the kitchen sink drain, or the kitchen sink faucet. For this leak, you will want to loosen the drain, and clean it thoroughly. If it is set in place, remove all of the previous plumber's putty by utilizing a scraper.</p>
<p>When a gas line is burst, it right away becomes a major safety threat. Without being fixed as quickly as possible, it could cause quite a bit of damage if the natural gas inside ends up being fired up.

Place a pail beneath the area to catch water then unscrew the two threaded caps that hold the curved section of the pipe in place. Nowadays, many kitchen drains are made of white PVC pipe with connections that can be unscrewed by hand.</p>

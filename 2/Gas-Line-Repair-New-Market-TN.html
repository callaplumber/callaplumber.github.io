<p>In some families, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to method when searching for a viable option, specifically when basic plunging does not seem to work. However, there are numerous downsides to utilizing these dangerous items - not least of which is that they generally consist of compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is causing a clog, which can range from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, small items, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your residential or commercial property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, but at the cost of presenting the threat of damage to your house and household.</p>

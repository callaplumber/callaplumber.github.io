<p>This is among the main and first questions that you must ask yourself when it concerns repiping and changing plumbing in your home. The age of your home is an important component to understand whether you ought to repipe your home. This is not just because your plumbing has actually aged with time, but likewise because homes that were constructed prior to a particular time period are more likely to include galvanized steel, known to be a metal that is obsolete in the world of plumbing and beyond due to its sensitivity to rust. If your home was built before the 1970s, we strongly advise that you work with a plumbing professional to check your home's plumbing and inspect if there are areas that need repiping. Chances are that your house may need substantial repiping so that your house's plumbing can work at optimal rates if your house was constructed decades before that.</p>
<p>The source or area of a sewer issue identifies who pays for repair. The City is accountable for the general public right-of-way (curb to curb), from one side of the street to another. The property owner is accountable for the area from the curb to the back of their property line. Easements (typically 10 feet large) where main sewage systems traverse private property are an exception to this guideline.</p>
<p>Do not utilize ground joint unions other than straight at the meter or after the shutoff valve at the home appliance. Each place where you will have a gas home appliance should have a gas shutoff valve. Within the City of Seattle just, any person who installs gas piping on property not under their ownership should have a Seattle Gas Piping Mechanic License. All gas piping setups need a license and inspection.</p>

<p>Waste Disposal Unit Installation Tired of False Guarantees? Water flows in the tank where small resin beads switch the calcium and magnesium in the water for the sodium or potassium they're holding.

Throughout this process, the resin beads are cleaned with the highly focused saltwater service (salt water) from the tank (made from the salt you added to the tank). The brine forces the calcium and magnesium ions to be launched from the beads and changed with salt or potassium ions.</p>

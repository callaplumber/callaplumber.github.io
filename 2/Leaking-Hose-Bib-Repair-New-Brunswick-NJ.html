Even small leaks can slowly moisten walls and floors up until they end up being breeding premises for mold, mildew, and other irritants.

A weird, gurgling sound coming from the toilet whenever you flush or from the bathtub drain after you took a bath is never a great indication. Possibilities are your sewer line is clogged, and a plunger might not be enough to address this concern. Call a plumber right away.</p>

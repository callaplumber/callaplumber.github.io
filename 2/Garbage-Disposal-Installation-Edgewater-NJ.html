Instead, our professionals utilize a rupturing tool that requires the existing pipeline to burst" and break apart. A brand-new pipeline is instantly drawn in and fills in the void developed by the old, burst pipe in a residential or commercial  sewer. This repair approach is generally used to replace the old pipe with a comparable or larger pipe.</p>

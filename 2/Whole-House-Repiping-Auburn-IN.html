<p>In addition to water softening systems, Rinckey said that reverse osmosis systems (ROs) are rather popular with property owners in the area. He kept in mind that there are specific impurities that homeowners are handling and an RO can help ease those concerns. Due to being largely agricultural in Montcalm and Ionia counties, some homeowners are setting up ROs to rid their water source of nitrates that are an item of agricultural waste. Rinckey noted that these systems remove around 94 percent of nitrates. Arsenic likewise naturally takes place in some soils and that too can be remedied with the best RO system.</p>

<p>Often, an inexperienced individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as easy as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he generates information on the workings of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's responsibility to understand what the field test information suggests for that specific assembly.  When a skilled tester interprets the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>

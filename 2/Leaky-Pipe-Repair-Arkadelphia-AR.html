<p>Clogged toilets are among the most common plumbing problems plumbers deal with, and for many people, it's an emergency when the toilet is all set to overflow. You can attempt to fix the clog yourself by using a plunger, which you can purchase your local hardware shop. The only purpose of salt in a water softener is to restore the resin beads that take the solidity out of water.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, you also need to think about the age of your system. If your system is getting near ten years old, it's typically not smart to spend for repairs if they are worth more than 50 percent of the cost of a new system. If problems become more regular with an older system, then it is recommended that you have the garbage disposal replaced.

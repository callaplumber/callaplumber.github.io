If it's too long, simply connect it to the disposal, mark it and suffice with a hacksaw for your waste disposal unit installation. (Loosen the other pipe connections, if needed, to place the tube back into the tee.) You might have to make a time-wasting trip to the store if the old discharge tube is too brief. To avoid this, make certain the brand-new waste disposal unit installation kit consists of a tube, or buy one individually at the exact same time for about $3.</p>

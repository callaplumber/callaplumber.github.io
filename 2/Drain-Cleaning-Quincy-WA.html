<p>Galvanized steel potable water supply and circulation pipes are frequently found with small pipe sizes from 3⁄8 inch (9.5 mm) to 2 inches (51 mm). It is hardly ever utilized today for new building and construction residential plumbing. Steel pipe has National Pipe Thread (NPT) standard tapered male threads, which connect with female tapered threads on elbows, tees, couplers, valves, and other fittings. Galvanized steel (frequently recognized just as "galv" or "iron" in the plumbing trade) is relatively costly, and tough to work with due to weight and requirement of a pipe threader It remains in common use for repair of existing "galv" systems and to please building regulations non-combustibility requirements generally found in hotels, apartment buildings and other commercial applications. It is also incredibly durable and resistant to mechanical abuse. Black lacquered steel pipe is the most extensively used pipe product for fire sprinklers and gas.</p>
<p>Almost all softeners fall into one of 2 categories. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will restore on a predetermined schedule and after that go back to service. These work well for homes that are on regular water-using cycles but will squander more water and salt since they regrow whether the resin requires it or not. Demand-control models, with either electrical and mechanical sensors, generally regrow after many gallons of water have actually been softened. Such designs are convenient if you have a rising and falling water use schedule.</p>

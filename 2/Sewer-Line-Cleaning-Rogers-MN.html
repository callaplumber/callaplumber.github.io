<p>Renovation plumbers usually charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one man and a truck. Once again, this doesn't include the cost of parts. However a growing number of plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their quotes are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily spend far more. With this method, you understand the turnkey rate entering into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's obligation, not yours.</p>
<p>Low hot water pressure? Our skilled plumbers can recognize and resolve your low water pressure problem. Indications of deterioration or scale accumulation on fixtures might indicate past leaks and high pressure. If there is a bigger issue needing attention, this can lead plumbers to examine. Working with gas is very unsafe, and it is essential to shut off the line to enable a safe repair process.</p>

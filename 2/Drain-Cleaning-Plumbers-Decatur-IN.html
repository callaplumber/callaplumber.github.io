<p>Eventually, nevertheless, the beads reach optimal capacity and can't bring in anymore mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank should be regrowed, or, flushed clean. That's where the brine tank can be found in. An on-board computer system computes the quantity of water that streams through the softener. Regeneration automatically begins when it reaches the preprogrammed setting. For a three-bedroom house and family of four, regeneration generally occurs every 12,000 gallons.</p>
<p>Sometimes, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as easy as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he generates information on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's task to understand what the field test information implies for that specific assembly.  When a qualified tester interprets the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>

The Water Quality Association, a not-for-profit trade association for the water treatment industry, has not been able to determine standards for these products and report irregular efficiency to date. Research study has revealed no change happens in the chemical and physical homes or the calcium ion concentration of water treated with the gadgets (The Water Quality Association Magnetics Job Force, 2001).</p>
<p>Clearly the resin is not an endless exchange site. When all the salt exchange sites are replaced with firmness minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this moment, the water softener will need to be operated on an alternate cycle called regeneration. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt service. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to utilize as soon as backwashing is complete. Some water softeners will automatically switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 illustrates both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>

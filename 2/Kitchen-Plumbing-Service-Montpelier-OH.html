Electric ranges are also much easier to install, and unlike gas systems, they are less most likely to lose heat.</p>

<p>Light Blue = Decreased Pressure Zone - supply pressure pushes open the # 1 check and is reduced by the # 1 Check spring (for instance, to 90 psi). This pressure difference across the # 1 check valve preserves the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone rises towards the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, avoiding backflow (reverse movement of fluid).</p>

<p>Water softeners, like the CareSoft Pro, work by eliminating an abundance of calcium and magnesium from water. Sediment from these aspects not only dry out your skin and hair but also build up in pipes and appliances decreasing their efficiency and life expectancy. Your washing machine, water and dishwasher heater are all adversely affected by difficult water. The impacts of hard water can be seen on your dishes, the color and softness of your clothing, the film on your shower door and even your personal appearance and convenience.</p>
<p>The mineral tank is the chamber where the difficult water is softened. The water supply line feeds the difficult water into the tank. The water seeps through the bed of resin beads, depositing the water-hardening calcium and magnesium ions. The water exits the tank soft and streams through your pipes and out to your household appliances. Backflow is a term used in the plumbing world to explain an unwanted flow of water in the reverse instructions. The backflow of water brings impurities back to the primary water system system, making the water in it risky to consume.</p>

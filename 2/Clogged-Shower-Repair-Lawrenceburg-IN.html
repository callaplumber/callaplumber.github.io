This pressure difference throughout the # 1 check valve keeps the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone increases towards the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, preventing backflow (reverse movement of fluid).</p>

Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is created due to the fact that of the process. When galvanized pipe is straight linked to copper pipe, a common example of this is. It is also worth noting that while using a brass fitting to bridge the space between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not entirely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to reduce this direct contact between the different metals.

<p>Also, if you have a 2-story house, it'll be more expensive to repipe due to the fact that the plumber will have to navigate through walls to do the job. Repiping plumbing lines in your home is a huge job - and it's a job you want to solve. However the variety of plumbing pipe products to select from can make it confusing. Here we take a look at a few of the attributes of the significant pipe types to help you select the right pipe for your plumbing.</p>
<p>Often, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as basic as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he generates information on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's responsibility to know what the field test information implies for that particular assembly.  When an experienced tester translates the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>

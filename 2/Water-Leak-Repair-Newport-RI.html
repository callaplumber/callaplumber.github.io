<p>Your waste disposal unit guarantees that your sink and plumbing fixtures do not get clogged. Contrary to some individuals's perception, waste disposal unit do not consist of blades. Instead, a garbage disposal includes two fixed bolts that are fixed to a spinning disk.

This high-speed action successfully pulverizes the food waste in the disposal so that it can travel down the drain without clogging.</p>

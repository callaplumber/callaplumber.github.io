<h3>Clogged Bathtub Drain in Newport Beach California</h2>
<p>If the problems happens well outside that 8 to 12 year lifespan, a rule of thumb is that you can regain the cost of the repair. If, state, you need a brand-new burner kit and the water heater is five years old, then it makes good sense for you to invest the $120 for the part, specifically if you can do the work yourself. The closer the home appliance is to that 8 to 12-year limitation, the more uncertain the economics of a repair becomes. The factor is that some other part on the device will go or its tank will leak. And there's no remedy for a leaking tank.</p>

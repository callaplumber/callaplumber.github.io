The pipe is typically 1/2 to 1-inch in diameter. Frequently, it goes into the house near the hot water heater. Your main shut off is attached to completion of the water main. Make certain you examine both ends of the pipe. We have discovered cases where the copper pipe enters the home and polybutylene is at the meter.</p>
<p>3. Think about a hair-stopper: The number 1 reason our Thousand Oaks drain cleaning professionals are called into a residence is due to the fact that there is too much hair in the shower drain.

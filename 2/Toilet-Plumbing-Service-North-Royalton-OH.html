<p>A. If you have rust spots, utilizing phosphoric acid generally will help remove them. If you would like to try the gentlest approach perhaps attempt utilizing some Coke on the rust initially.  No, we aren't joking, Coca-Cola contains a trace quantity of phosphoric acid. To attempt this, drain the toilet bowl to below where the rust marks are. Then pour on some Coke. Clean with a soft fabric and after that more Coke, over and over, and so on. If that doesn't do the trick then use Naval Jelly which includes a lot more phosphoric acid (make certain to check out the instructions and security warnings initially!). Naval Jelly is what we here at ® use to get rid of rust discolorations and it's easily offered at a lot of hardware stores.</p>

Though it may require extra adapters, flexible tubing is far simpler to deal with and can make use of push-to-connect fittings, saving you time and the trouble of soldering.</p>
<p>Presented more than a decade ago, Uponor ProPEX fittings remain the best technique for making leak-proof Uponor PEX-a connections quickly and easy. Profiting from the special, thermal shape memory of Uponor's PEX-a tubing, fittings in fact get more powerful over time.

<p>Backpressure may happen when the potable supply piping is connected to a system or component which exceeds the operating pressure of the supply piping. Higher pressure can be brought on by booster pumps, boilers, pressure vessels, or raised piping in locations such as high-rise buildings or tanks. If these connections are not correctly safeguarded, drinkable and non-potable water or liquids can be forced into the drinkable supply system.</p>

<p>A cross-connection is any permanent or short-lived connection between a public water system or customer's safe and clean (i.e., drinking) water supply and any source or system consisting of nonpotable water or other substances. An example is the piping in between a public water supply or customer's drinkable water system and an auxiliary water supply, cooling system or irrigation system.</p>

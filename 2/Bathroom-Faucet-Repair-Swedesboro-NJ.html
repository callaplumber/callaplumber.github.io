For home, it is very important for owners to signal the District if any changes are made, such as digging a new well. For commercial property, the District reviews making use of each new renter. The correction must be made prior to water service is permitted if the existing backflow is not up to District code. Cost for the device is covered by either the renter or the property owner.</p>

The majority of commercial usage backflow prevention setups make use of a valve system that gets in touch with the irrigation line within your organisation, where watering meets the main water supply. From here, the preventer can keep track of the movement of water within your system, and prevent any prospective back-pressure and back-siphonage that might be brought on by malfunctioning plumbing equipment.

<p>Sometimes, an inexperienced individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as basic as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he creates data on the operations of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's responsibility to know what the field test data implies for that specific assembly.  When an experienced tester interprets the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>

<p>Often, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as easy as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he generates data on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's duty to understand what the field test information means for that particular assembly.  When a trained tester translates the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>

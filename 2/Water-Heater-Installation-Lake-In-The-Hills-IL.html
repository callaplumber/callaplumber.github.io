<p>Check Valve (DCV) - safe for usage both inside and underground, DCVs are a bit more expensive but are also highly hassle-free, as they can be installed horizontally or vertically. Video cameras are useful in locating buried septic systems or examining the condition of buried pipes to figure out proper maintenance schedules or the extent of required repairs. When the corrupt salesperson takes control of the camera, he may play a pre-taped inspection of a pipe in extremely bad condition and say it is your pipe.</p>
<p>Anode Rod Failure: This metal rod is normally made of aluminum or magnesium and remains as a point of contact with the water in your tank.

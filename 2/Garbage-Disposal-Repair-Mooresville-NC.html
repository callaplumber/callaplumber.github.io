<p>The electrical and plumbing work associated with garbage disposal installation make the job potentially hazardous.

<p>If you have an older house, there's a likelihood you have galvanized pipes. And if your home was built in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are probably nearing completion of their lifespan.

Corroded pipes also result in poor water quality and low water pressure.</p>
<p>In some families, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to method when looking for a feasible option, especially when easy plunging does not seem to work. Nevertheless, there are lots of drawbacks to using these hazardous items - not least of which is that they typically consist of substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is triggering a clog, which can vary from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, little things, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, but at the cost of providing the threat of harm to your home and household.</p>

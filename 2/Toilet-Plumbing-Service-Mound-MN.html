<p>When your bathtub drains or your toilet flushes is never ever a good sign, a weird gurgling noise. Do not depend upon a plunger to fix the problem-- depend upon your plumber for sewer line repair.

Most fire sprinkler heads, except sprinkler heads on a deluge system are kept closed by a heat-sensitive operating system. Generally, this operating mechanism is either a fusible link or a glass bulb.  Despite the operating mechanism, just the sprinklers that are exposed to heat will open during a fire.</p>

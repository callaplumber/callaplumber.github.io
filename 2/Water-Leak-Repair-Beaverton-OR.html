<p>The electrical and plumbing work involved in waste disposal unit installation make the job potentially harmful. That makes it a terrific factor to employ a professional plumber to install or replace your disposal. House owners can either purchase the brand-new disposal themselves and offer it to the professional for installation, or let the plumber purchase the disposal on their behalf and include it in the total cost.</p>
<p>Replacing the old disposal with a similar brand-new one is less complicated than replacing with a different design.

When linked at the sink drain, the dishwasher connector is attached. The last thing is to wire up the new disposal, making sure to link wires accurately, and the base covered to secure the circuitry from any water getting in.</p>

<p>Determining if you need a water softener is an individual choice. Water softener systems work by removing solidity minerals and replacing them with sodium ions. Water conditioners are devices that help prevent the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They use a physical media to inhibit the scale from building up by neutralizing the firmness itself. Due to the reality that water conditioners utilize a physical media rather of a chemical media, they are often considered a greener alternative in areas where it is prohibited to use salt. Water conditioners do not efficiently remove hardness from the water supply, however, as the only method to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>
<p>The Customized Select blending valve enables you to change the solidity of the water so you can have your water, your method. Lead pipes, utilized in the early 1900s, have a life span of 100 years, but they can leach lead into your drinking water, a major health danger.

<h3>Most Effective Drain Cleaning Methods Kingston TN</h3>
<p>These people were incredible! They appeared early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been an issue off and on for years now. It was installed 7 years ago, and it never ever drained this well. I chose this company because they had great reviews and a fair price, and even though the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a substantial, disgusting mess on their hands (literally), and they did a terrific job cleaning up after it too.</p>

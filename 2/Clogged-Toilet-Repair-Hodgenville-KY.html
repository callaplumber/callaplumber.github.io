<p>The trick to preventing a clogged garbage disposal is moderation. As long as the food waste is sent through the disposal at an affordable amount, there should be no concern in getting the majority of the waste through. There are a few food items you should probably not take into the garbage disposal though. Those items are coffee grounds, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another pointer to stop clogging is to keep an eye out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will solidify when they cool so it is best to wash pots and pans that have those liquids under hot water and to continue to let the water run for several seconds after you are finished cleaning to ensure the drain is clear.</p>

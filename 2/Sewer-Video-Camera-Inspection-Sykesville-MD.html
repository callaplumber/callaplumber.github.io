<p>If you notice low water pressure or discolored water, it normally symbolizes rust and mineral accumulation. As rust and minerals build up gradually, they constrict the flow of the water which is why you might observe lower water pressure. The discoloration occurs when rust becomes loose from the pipes and circulation into your supply of water, affecting the water quality. Having plumbing pipes that have rust or deterioration can end up being a health hazard in your water.</p>
<p>In the meantime, however, we recommend you first shot using non-harsh and non-abrasive white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Merely pour a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, include some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mix sit for a while. If that does not work, you can attempt a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner. Many of these cleaners consist of concentrated levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be really damaging if it is available in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. If using one of these products, please make sure to take the appropriate safety measures.</p>
